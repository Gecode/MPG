\chapter{Integer and Boolean variables and constraints}
\label{chap:m:int}

This chapter gives an overview of integer and Boolean variables
and the constraints available for them in Gecode. The chapter
focuses on variables and constraints, a discussion of branching
for integer and Boolean variables can be found in
\autoref{sec:m:branch:int}.

The chapter does not make an attempt to duplicate the reference
documentation (see \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelInt}). It is
concerned with the most important ideas and principles underlying
integer and Boolean variables and constraints. In particular, the
chapter provides entry points into the reference documentation
and points to illustrating examples.

\paragraph{Overview.}

\mbox{}\autoref{sec:m:integer:var} details how integer and Boolean
variables (and variables in general) can be used for modeling.
Variable arrays and argument arrays are discussed in
\autoref{sec:m:integer:proper}. Important aspects of how
constraints are posted in Gecode are explained in
\autoref{sec:m:integer:generic}.  These sections belong to the
basic reading material of \autoref{part:m}.

The remaining sections \autoref{sec:m:integer:post} and
\autoref{sec:m:integer:exec} provide an overview of the
constraints that are available for integer and Boolean variables
in Gecode.

\begin{important}
  Do not forget to add
\begin{code}
#include <gecode/int.hh>
\end{code}
to your program when you want to use integer or Boolean variables
and constraints.
\end{important}

\begin{convention}
  All program fragments and references to classes, namespaces,
  and other entities assume that declarations and definitions
  from the \?Gecode?  namespace are visible: for example, by
  adding
\begin{code}
using namespace Gecode;
\end{code}
to your program.

The variable \?home? refers to a space reference (of type
\?Space&?) and defines the home space in which new variables,
propagators, and branchers are posted. Often (as in
\autoref{chap:m:started} and \autoref{chap:m:comfy}) \?home? will
be \?*this?, referring to the current space.
\end{convention}

\section{Integer and Boolean variables}
\label{sec:m:integer:var}

Variables in Gecode are for modeling. They provide operations for
creation, access, and update during cloning. By design, the only
way to modify (constrain) a variable is by post functions for
constraints and branchers.

Integer variables are instances of the class
\gecoderef[class]{IntVar} while Boolean variables are instances
of the class \gecoderef[class]{BoolVar}. Integer variables are
\emph{not} related to Boolean variables. A Boolean variable is
\emph{not} an integer variable with a domain that is included in
$\{0,1\}$. The only way to get an integer variable that is equal
to a Boolean variable is by posting a channeling constraint
between them (see
\autoref{sec:m:integer:channel}).

\tip{Do not use views for modeling}{%
  If you --- after some browsing of the reference documentation
  --- should come across integer views such as \?IntView?, you
  might notice that views have a richer interface than
  integer variables. You might feel that this interface looks too
  powerful to be ignored. Now, you really should put some trust in
  this document: views are \emph{not} for modeling. 

  The more powerful interface only works within propagators and
  branchers, see \autoref{part:p} and \autoref{part:b}.  }

\subsection{Creating integer variables}
\label{sec:m:integer:create}

A variable provides a read-only interface to a \emph{variable
  implementation} where the same variable implementation can be
referred to by arbitrarily many variables.

New integer variables are created by using a constructor. A new integer variable \?x? is created
by
\begin{code}
IntVar x(home, -4, 20);
\end{code}
This declares a variable \?x? of type \gecoderef[class]{IntVar}
in the space \?home?, creates a new integer \emph{variable
implementation} with domain $\{-4,\ldots,20\}$, and points \?x?
to the newly created integer variable implementation.

The domain of a variable can also be specified by an
integer set \gecoderef[class]{IntSet}, for example by
\begin{code}
IntVar x(home, IntSet(-4, 20));
\end{code}
which creates a new variable with domain $\{-4,\ldots,20\}$.  An
attempt to create an integer variable with an empty domain throws
an exception of type \gecoderef[class]{Int::VariableEmptyDomain}.

\tip{Initializing variables}{
\label{tip:m:integer:init}%
Variables do not have an initialization function. However, new
variables can be also created by
\begin{code}
IntVar x;
x = IntVar(home, -4, 20);
\end{code}
}

The default or copy constructor of a variable does not create a
new variable (that is, a new variable implementation). Instead,
the variable does not refer to any variable implementation
(default constructor) or to the same variable implementation
(copy constructor). For example, in
\begin{code}
IntVar x(home, 1, 4);
IntVar y(x);
\end{code}
both \?x? and \?y? refer to the same integer variable
implementation. Using a default constructor and
an assignment operator is equivalent:
\begin{code}
IntVar x(home, 1, 4);
IntVar y;
y=x;
\end{code}

\subsection{Limits for integer values}
\label{sec:m:integer:limits}

The set of values for an integer variable is a subset of the
values of the type \?int?. The set of values is symmetric:
$-\mbox{\?Int::Limits::min?}=\mbox{\?Int::Limits::max?}$ for the
smallest possible integer variable value \?Int::Limits::min? and the
largest possible integer variable value \?Int::Limits::max?.  Moreover,
\?Int::Limits::max? is strictly smaller than the largest possible
integer value \?INT_MAX? and \?Int::Limits::min? is strictly
larger than the smallest possible integer value \?INT_MIN?. These
limits are defined in the namespace \gecoderef[namespace]{Int::Limits}.

Any attempt to create a variable with values outside the defined
limits throws an exception of type
\gecoderef[class]{Int::OutOfLimits}. The same holds true for any
attempt to use an integer value outside the defined limits when
posting a constraint or brancher.

\subsection{Variable domains are never empty}
\label{sec:m:integer:empty}

An important invariant in Gecode is that the domain of a variable
is never empty. When a variable domain should become empty during
propagation, the space is failed but the variable's domain is
kept.  In fact, this is the very reason why an attempt to create
a variable with an empty domain, for example by
\begin{code}
IntVar x(home, 1, 0);
\end{code}
throws an exception of type
\gecoderef[class]{Int::VariableEmptyDomain}.


\tip{Small variable domains are beautiful}{%
\label{tip:m:integer:beautifuldomains}%
  It is not an omission that an integer variable has no
  constructor that creates a variable with the largest possible
  domain. One could argue that a constructor like that would come
  in handy for creating temporary variables. After all, one would
  not have to worry about the exact domain!
  
  Sorry, but one has to worry. The apparent omission is
  deliberate to make you worry indeed. For many propagators
  posted for a constraint a small domain is essential. For
  example, when posting a \?linear?  constraint (as in
  \autoref{sec:m:started:first}), variable domains that are too
  large might result in an exception of type
  \gecoderef[class]{Int::OutOfLimits} as during propagation
  numerical overflow might occur (even if Gecode resorts to a
  number type supporting larger numbers than \?int? for
  propagating \?linear?). Moreover, the runtime of other
  propagators (for example, many domain propagators
  such as domain consistent \?distinct?) depend critically on the
  size of a domain. Again, Gecode tries to be clever in most of
  the cases. But, it is better to make it a habit to think about
  initial variable domains carefully (please remember: better
  safe than sorry).
  
  For examples where small variable domains matter, see
  \autoref{tip:c:golomb:beautifuldomains} and
  \autoref{tip:c:warehouses:beautifuldomains}.
}

\subsection{Creating Boolean variables}

The only difference between integer and Boolean variables is that
Boolean variables can only take the values \?0? or \?1?. Any
attempt to create a Boolean variable with values different from
\?0? or \?1? throws an exception of type
\gecoderef[class]{Int::NotZeroOne}.

\begin{convention}
  If Boolean variables are not explicitly mentioned in the following, the
  same functionality for integer variables is also available for
  Boolean variables and has the same behavior.
\end{convention}

\subsection{Variable access functions}

Variables provide member functions for access, such as \?x.min()?
for the minimum value of the current domain for an integer or
Boolean variable \?x?. In particular, the member function
\?x.val()?  accesses the integer value of an already assigned
variable (if the variable is not yet assigned, an exception of
type \gecoderef[class]{Int::ValOfUnassignedVar} is thrown). In
addition, variables can be printed by the standard output
operator \?<<?.
%>>

\subsection{Iterating over integer variable domains}
\label{sec:m:int:iter}

The entire domain of an integer variable can be accessed by a
\emph{value iterator} \gecoderef[class]{IntVarValues} or a
\emph{range iterator} \gecoderef[class]{IntVarRanges}. For
example, the loop
\begin{code}
for (IntVarValues i(x); i(); ++i)
  std::cout << i.val() << ' ';
\end{code}
%>>
uses the value iterator \?i? to print all values of the domain of
the integer variable \?x?. The call operator \?i()? tests whether
there are more values to iterate for \?i?, the prefix increment
operator \?++i?  moves the iterator \?i? to the next value, and
\?i.val()? returns the current value of the iterator \?i?. The
values are iterated in strictly increasing order.

Similarly, the following loop 
\begin{code}
for (IntVarRanges i(x); i(); ++i)
  std::cout << i.min() << ".." << i.max() << ' ';
\end{code}
%>>
uses the range iterator \?i? to print all \emph{ranges} of the
integer variable \?x?. Given a finite set of integers $d$, the
\emph{range sequence} of $d$ is the shortest (and unique) sequence of ranges
(intervals)
$$
\langle\range{n_0}{m_0}\},\ldots,\range{n_k}{m_k}\}\rangle
$$
such that the sequence is ordered and non-adjacent
($m_i+1<n_{i+1}$ for $0\leq i<k$). A range iterator iterates over
the ranges in the range sequence of a variable's domain. Like a value
iterator, a range iterator implements the call operator \?i()? to test
whether there are more ranges to iterate for \?i? and the prefix
increment operator \?++i? to move \?i? to the next range. As a
range iterator \?i? iterates over ranges, it implements the
member functions \?i.min()? and \?i.max()? for the minimal,
respectively maximal, value of the current range.

Iteration of values and ranges for Boolean variables is not
available (as it is not needed).

\subsection{When to inspect a variable}
\label{sec:m:integer:inspect}

Note that one must not change the domain of a variable (for
example, by posting a constraint on that variable) while an
iterator for that variable is still in use. This is the same as
for most iterators, for example, for iterators in the \CPP{}
Standard Template Library (STL).

Otherwise, a variable can always be inspected: at any place (that
is, not only in member functions of the variable's home) and at
any time (regardless of the status of a space). If the variable's
home is failed, the variable can still be inspected.  However, it
might be the case that the variable domain has more values than
expected. For example, after creating a variable \?x? with the
singleton domain $\{0\}$ and posting the constraint that \?x?
must be different from \?0? by (read \autoref{tip:m:started:status}
about \?status()?):
\begin{code}
IntVar x(home, 0, 0);
rel(home, x, IRT_NQ, 0);
(void) home.status();
\end{code}
the space \?home? is failed but the variable \?x? still contains
the value \?0? in its domain.



\subsection{Updating variables}
\label{sec:m:integer:update}

As discussed in \autoref{sec:m:started:first}, a variable must be
updated during cloning in the copy constructor used by a space's
\?copy()? member function. For example, a variable \?x?  is updated
by
\begin{code}
x.update(home, share, y);
\end{code}
where \?share? is the Boolean argument passed as argument to
\?copy()? and \?y? is the variable from which \?x? is to be
updated. While \?x? belongs to \?home?, \?y? belongs
to the space being cloned.

A space only needs to update the variables that are part of the
solution, so that their values can be accessed after a solution
space has been found. Temporary variables do not need to be
copied. 

Assume that we want to constrain the integer
variable \?p? to be the product of \?x?, \?y?, and \?z?. Gecode
only offers multiplication of two variable, hence a temporary
variable \?t? is created (assume also that we know that the
values for \?t? are between \?0? and \?1000?):
\begin{code}
IntVar t(home, 0, 1000);
mult(home, x, y, t);
mult(home, t, z, p);
\end{code}
Here, \?t? does not require updating. The multiplication
propagators created by \?mult? take care of updating the variable
implementation of \?t?.


\section{Variable and argument arrays}
\label{sec:m:integer:proper}


Gecode has very few \emph{proper} data structures. The proper
data structures for integer and Boolean variables are the
variables themselves, integer sets, and arrays of variables.
Proper means that these data structures can be updated and hence
be stored in a space. Other proper data structures are
DFAs (deterministic finite automata) and tuple sets used for
extensional constraints. These data structures are discussed
in \autoref{sec:m:integer:extensional}.

Of course, data structures that themselves do not contain proper
data structures can be stored in a space, such as integers,
pointers, and strings.

Gecode supports the programming of new proper data structures,
this is discussed in \autoref{sec:p:memory:shared}.

\subsection{Integer and Boolean variable arrays}
\label{sec:m:integer:intvararray}

Integer variable arrays of type \gecoderef[class]{IntVarArray}
can be used like variables. For example,
\begin{code}
IntVarArray x(home, 4, -10, 10);
\end{code}
creates a new integer variable array with four variables
containing newly created variables with domain
$\{-10,\ldots,10\}$. Boolean variable arrays of type
\gecoderef[class]{BoolVarArray} are analogous.

Creation of a variable array allocates memory from the home
space. The memory is freed when the space is deleted (not
when the destructor of the variable array is called). Variable
arrays can be created without creating new variables by just
passing the size. That is,
\begin{code}
IntVarArray x(home, 4);
for (int i=0; i<4; i++)
  x[i] = IntVar(home, -10, 10);
\end{code}
is equivalent to the previous example.

The other operations on variable arrays are as one would expect.
For example, one can check whether all variables are assigned 
using the \?assigned()? function. More importantly, variable arrays
like variables have an update
function and variable arrays must be updated during cloning. In
the following, we will refer to the size of a variable array \?x?
by $|\mathtt x|$ (which can be computed by \?x.size()?).

\paragraph{Matrix interface.}

Many models are naturally expressed by using matrices. Gecode
offers support that superimposes a matrix interface for modeling
on an array, see \autoref{sec:m:minimodel:matrix}.

\subsection{Argument arrays}
\label{sec:m:integer:args}

As mentioned above, the memory allocated for a variable array is
freed only when its home space is deleted. That makes variable
arrays \emph{unsuited} for temporary variable arrays, in particular
for arrays that are built dynamically or used as arguments for post 
functions.

For this reason, Gecode provides argument arrays: \?IntVarArgs? for
integer variables, \?BoolVarArgs? for Boolean variables, 
\?IntArgs? for integers, and \?IntSetArgs? for integer sets (see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntArgs}). Internally, they allocate
space from the heap\footnote{Actually, if an argument array has
  few fields it uses some space that is part of the object
  implementing the array rather than allocating memory from the
  heap.  Hence, small argument arrays reside entirely on the
  stack.} and the memory is freed when their destructor is
executed. They are \emph{not} proper data structures as they
cannot be updated.

Argument arrays can be created empty:
\begin{code}
IntVarArgs x;
\end{code}
with a certain size but without initializing the elements:
\begin{code}
IntVarArgs x(5);
\end{code}
or fully initialized:
\begin{code}
IntVarArgs x(home,5,0,10);
\end{code}

For a typical example, consider \autoref{sec:m:started:first} where
an integer argument array and an integer variable argument array
are used to pass coefficients and variables to the \?linear? post
function. 

\paragraph{Dynamic argument arrays.}

In contrast to variable arrays, argument arrays can grow dynamically by adding 
elements or whole arrays using \?operator<<?:
\begin{code}
IntVarArgs x;
x << IntVar(home,0,10);
IntVarArgs y;
y << IntVar(home,10,20);
y << x;
linear(home, IntVarArgs()<<x[0]<<x[1], IRT_EQ, 0);
\end{code}
Furthermore, argument arrays can be concatenated using \?operator+?:
\begin{code}
IntVarArgs z = x+y;
\end{code}

\paragraph{Slices.}

It is sometimes necessary to post constraints on a subsequence of
the variables in an array. This is made possible by the
\?slice(start,inc,n)? method of variable and argument arrays. The
\?start? parameter gives the starting index of the subsequence.
The \?inc? optional parameter gives the increment, i.e., how to
get from one element to the next (its default is $1$). The \?n?
parameter gives the maximal length of the resulting array (its
default is $-1$, meaning as long as possible). 

The following examples should make this clearer. Assume that the
integer variable argument array \?x? is initialized as
follows:
\begin{code}
IntVarArgs x(home, 10, 0, 10);
\end{code}

Then the following calls of \?slice()? return:
\begin{itemize}
\item \?x.slice(5)? returns an array with elements \?x[5],x[6],...,x[9]?.
\item \?x.slice(5,1,3)? returns \?x[5],x[6],x[7]?.
\item \?x.slice(5,-1)? returns \?x[5],x[4],...,x[0]?.
\item \?x.slice(3,3)? returns \?x[3],x[6],x[9]?.
\item \?x.slice(8,-2)? returns \?x[8],x[6],x[4],x[2],x[0]?.
\item \?x.slice(8,-2,3)? returns \?x[8],x[6],x[4]?.
\end{itemize}

\tip{Reversing argument arrays}{%
The \?slice()? method can be used to compute an array with the
elements of \?x? in reverse order like this:
\begin{code}
x.slice(x.size()-1,-1)
\end{code}
}

\paragraph{Creating integer argument arrays.}

Integer argument arrays with simple sequences of integers can be
generated using the static method
\?IntArgs::create(n,start,inc)?. The \?n? parameter gives the
length of the generated array. The \?start? parameter is the
starting value, and \?inc? determines the increment from one
value to the next. 

Here are a few examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item \?IntArgs::create(5,0)? creates an array with elements
  \?0,1,2,3,4?.
\item \?IntArgs::create(5,4,-1)? creates \?4,3,2,1,0?.
\item \?IntArgs::create(3,2,0)? creates \?2,2,2?.
\item \?IntArgs::create(6,2,2)? creates \?2,4,6,8,10,12?.
\end{itemize}

\begin{litcode}[texonly]{dynamic script}
  class Script : public Space {
    IntVarArray x;
  public:
    Script(void) {
      \begin{litblock}{read data}
      IntVarArgs _x;
      while (...) {
        ...
        _x << IntVar(*this,...);
      }
      \end{litblock}
      ...
      \begin{litblock}{initialize variable array}
      x = IntVarArray(*this,_x);
      \end{litblock}
    }
    ...
  }
\end{litcode}

\tip{Dynamically constructing models}{%
  Sometimes the number of variables cannot be determined easily,
  for example when it depends on data read from a file. 

\begin{samepage}
Suppose
  the following script with a variable array \?x?:
\insertlitcode{dynamic script}
\end{samepage}

  It is easy to use a variable argument array \?_x? for
  collecting variables as follows:
\insertlitcode{dynamic script:read data}
and then initialize the variable array \?x?
  using the argument array:
\insertlitcode{dynamic script:initialize variable array}
}

In the following we do not distinguish between arrays and
argument arrays unless operations require a certain type of
array. In fact, all post functions for constraints and branchers
only accept variable argument arrays. A variable array is
automatically casted to a variable argument array if needed.


\subsection{STL-style iterators}
\label{sec:m:integer:stl}

All arrays in Gecode (including variable arrays and argument
arrays) also support STL-style (Standard Template Library) iterators. For example, assume
that \?a? is an integer variable argument array. Then
\begin{code}
for (IntVarArgs::iterator i = a.begin(); i != a.end(); ++i) {
   ...
}
\end{code}
creates an iterator \?i? for the elements of \?a? and iterates
from the first to the last element in~\?a?.

More powerfully, iterators give you the ability to work with STL
algorithms. Suppose that \?f()? is a function that takes an
integer variable by reference such as in
\begin{code}
void f(IntVar& x) { ... }
\end{code}
and \?a? is an integer variable argument array. Then
\begin{code}
#include <algorithm>

std::for_each(a.begin(), a.end(), f); 
\end{code}
applies the function \?f()? to each integer variable in \?a?.


\section{Posting constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:generic}

This section provides information about general principles for
posting constraints over integer and Boolean variables.

\subsection{Post functions are clever}

A constraint post function carefully analyzes its
arguments. Based on this analysis, the constraint post function
chooses the best possible propagator for the constraint. 

For
example, when posting a \?distinct? constraint (see
\autoref{sec:m:integer:distinct}) for the variable array \?x? by
\begin{code}
distinct(home, x);
\end{code}
where \?x? has two elements, the much more efficient propagator
for disequality $\mathtt{x}_0 \neq \mathtt{x}_1$ is created.

\subsection{Everything is copied}

When passing arguments to a post function, all data structures
that are needed for creating a propagator (or several
propagators) implementing a constraint are copied. That is, none
of the data structures that are passed as arguments are needed
after a constraint has been posted.

\subsection{Reified constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:reify}

Many constraints also exist as \emph{reified} variants: the
validity of a constraint is reflected to a Boolean control
variable (reified constraints are also known as
meta-constraints). In addition to full reification also half
reification~\cite{HalfReify} is supported for reified
constraints.  Whether a reified version exists for a given
constraint can be found in the reference documentation. If a
reified version does exist, the Boolean control variable (and
possibly information about the reification mode, to be discussed
in \autoref{sec:m:integer:halfreify}) is passed as the last
non-optional argument.

For example, posting
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_EQ, y, b);
\end{code}
for integer variables \?x? and \?y? and a Boolean control
variable \?b? creates a propagator for the reified constraint
$\reifyeqv{\mathtt{b}}{\mathtt{x}=\mathtt{y}}$ that propagates
according to the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item If \?b? is assigned to \?1?, the constraint
  $\mathtt{x}=\mathtt{y}$ is propagated.
\item If \?b? is assigned to \?0?, the constraint
  $\mathtt{x}\neq\mathtt{y}$ is propagated.
\item If the constraint $\mathtt{x}=\mathtt{y}$ holds, then
  $\mathtt{b}=\mathtt{1}$ is propagated.
\item If the constraint $\mathtt{x}\neq\mathtt{y}$ holds, then
  $\mathtt{b}=\mathtt{0}$ is propagated.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Half reification}
\label{sec:m:integer:halfreify}

Reification as discussed in the previous paragraph is also known
as \emph{full} reification as it propagates a full equivalence
between the constraint $c$ and the constraint that a Boolean
control variable is equal to \?1?. \emph{Half reification}
propagates only one direction of the
equivalence~\cite{HalfReify}. Half reification can be used by
passing an object of class \gecoderef[class]{Reify} that combines
a Boolean control variable and a \emph{reification mode} of type
\?ReifyMode? (see \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelInt}).

For example, the half reified constraint
$\reifyimp{\mathtt{b}}{\mathtt{x}=\mathtt{y}}$ for
integer variables \?x? and \?y? and a Boolean control variable
\?b? can be posted by 
\begin{code}
Reify r(b, RM_IMP);
rel(home, x, IRT_EQ, y, r);
\end{code}
and is propagated as follows (\?RM_IMP? suggests
\emph{implication} $\Rightarrow$):
\begin{itemize}
\item If \?b? is assigned to \?1?, the constraint
  $\mathtt{x}=\mathtt{y}$ is propagated.
\item If the constraint $\mathtt{x}\neq\mathtt{y}$ holds, then
  $\mathtt{b}=\mathtt{0}$ is propagated.
\end{itemize}

Likewise, the half reified constraint
$\reifypmi{\mathtt{b}}{\mathtt{x}=\mathtt{y}}$ for
integer variables \?x? and \?y? and a Boolean control variable
\?b? can be posted by
\begin{code}
Reify r(b, RM_PMI);
rel(home, x, IRT_EQ, y, r);
\end{code}
and is propagated as follows (\?RM_PMI? suggests \emph{inverse
  implication} $\Leftarrow$):
\begin{itemize}
\item If \?b? is assigned to \?0?, the constraint
  $\mathtt{x}\neq\mathtt{y}$ is propagated.
\item If the constraint $\mathtt{x}=\mathtt{y}$ holds, then
  $\mathtt{b}=\mathtt{1}$ is propagated.
\end{itemize}

Full reification can be requested by the reification mode
\?RM_EQV? (for equivalence $\Leftrightarrow$) as follows:
\begin{code}
Reify r(b, RM_EQV);
rel(home, x, IRT_EQ, y, r);
\end{code}
As the constructor for \gecoderef[class]{Reify} has \?RM_EQV? as
default value for its second argument, this can be written
shorter as:
\begin{code}
Reify r(b);
rel(home, x, IRT_EQ, y, r);
\end{code}
or even shorter as:
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_EQ, y, b);
\end{code}

For convenience, three functions \?eqv()?, \?imp()?, and \?pmi()?
exist that take a Boolean variable and return a corresponding
object of class \gecoderef[class]{Reify}. For example, instead of
writing:
\begin{code}
Reify r(b, RM_IMP);
rel(home, x, IRT_EQ, y, r);
\end{code}
one can write more concisely:
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_EQ, y, imp(b));
\end{code}


\subsection{Selecting the consistency level}
\label{sec:m:integer:icl}

For many constraints, Gecode provides different propagators with
different levels of consistency. All constraint post functions take an
optional argument of type \?IntConLevel? (see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelInt}) controlling which propagator is
chosen for a particular constraint.

The different values for \?IntConLevel? have the following
meaning:
\begin{itemize}
\item \?ICL_VAL?: perform value propagation. A typical example is
  naive \?distinct?: wait until a variable becomes assigned to a
  value $n$, then prune $n$ from all other variables.

\item \?ICL_BND?: perform bounds propagation or achieve bounds
  consistency. This captures both bounds consistency over the
  integers (for example, for \?distinct?, see \autoref{sec:m:integer:distinct}) or bounds consistency
  over the real numbers (for example, for \?linear?, see \autoref{sec:m:integer:linear}). For more
  information on bounds consistency over integers or real
  numbers, see~\cite{bounds-consistency}. 
  
  Some propagators that are selected might not even achieve
  bounds consistency but the idea is that the propagator performs
  propagation by reasoning on the bounds of variable domains.

\item \?ICL_DOM?: perform domain propagation or achieve domain
  consistency. Most propagators selected by \?ICL_DOM? achieve
  domain consistency but some just perform propagation by taking
  entire variable domains for propagation into account (for
  example, \?circuit?, see \autoref{sec:m:integer:circuit}).

\item \?ICL_DEF?: choose default consistency level for this
  constraint.
\end{itemize}

Whether bounds or domain consistency is achieved and the default
consistency level for a constraint are mentioned in the reference
documentation for each post function.

\tip{Different consistency levels have different costs}{
Note that propagators of different consistency
level for the very same constraint can have vastly different cost. In
general, propagation for \?ICL_VAL? will be cheapest, while
propagation for \?ICL_DOM? will be most expensive. 

The reference documentation for a constraint lists whether propagation for a
particular consistency level might have prohibitive cost for a
large number of variables or a large number of values in the
variables' domains. For example, for the \?linear? constraint
with $n$ variables and at most $d$ values for each variable, the
complexity to perform bounds propagation (that is, \?ICL_BND?) is
$O(n)$ whereas the complexity for domain propagation (that is,
\?ICL_DOM?) is $O(d^n)$.  }

\subsection{Exceptions}

Many post functions check their arguments for consistency before
attempting to create a propagator. For each post function, the
reference documentation lists which exceptions might be thrown.

\subsection{Unsharing arguments}

Some constraints can only deal with \emph{non-shared} variable
arrays: a variable is not allowed to appear more than once in the
array (more precisely: no unassigned variable implementation
appears more than once in the array). An attempt to post one of these
constraints with shared variable arrays will throw an exception
of type \gecoderef[class]{Int::ArgumentSame}.

To be able to post one of these constraints on shared variable
arrays, Gecode provides a function \?unshare? (see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntUnshare}) that takes a variable
argument array \?x? as argument as in:
\begin{code}
unshare(home, x);
\end{code}
It replaces each but the first occurrence of a variable $y$ in
\?x? by a new variable $z$, and creates a propagator $y=z$ for
each new variable $z$.

Note that \?unshare? requires a variable argument array and
\emph{not} a variable array. If \?x?  is a variable array, the
following
\begin{code}
IntVarArgs y(x);
\end{code}
creates a variable argument array \?y? containing the same
variables as \?x?.

\tip{Unsharing is expensive}{%
  It is important to keep in mind that \?unshare? creates new
  variables and propagators. This is also the reason why
  unsharing is not done implicitly by a post function for a
  constraint that does not accept shared variable arrays. 

\begin{samepage}  
  Consider the following example using \?extensional? constraints
  for a variable argument array \?x?  possibly containing a
  variable more than once, where \?a? and \?b? are two different
  DFAs (see \autoref{sec:m:integer:extensional} for \?extensional?
  constraints). By
\begin{code}
unshare(home, x);
extensional(home, x, a);
extensional(home, x, b);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}  
multiple occurrences of the same variable in \?x? are unshared
\emph{once} and the propagators for extensional can work on the
same non-shared array.

If unsharing were implicit, the following
\begin{code}
extensional(home, x, a);
extensional(home, x, b);
\end{code}
would unshare \?x? twice and create many more (useless)
propagators and variables.  Rather than implicitly unsharing the
same array over and over again (and hence creating variables and
propagators), unsharing is made explicit and should be done only
once, if possible.

\section{Constraint overview}
\label{sec:m:integer:post}

This section provides an overview of the constraints and their
post functions available for integer and Boolean variables.

\subsection{Domain constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:dom}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntDomain} constrain integer variables
and variable arrays to values from a given domain. For example,
by
\begin{code}
dom(home, x, 2, 12);
\end{code}
the values of the variable \?x? (or of all variables in a
variable array \?x?) are constrained to be between $2$ and $12$.
Domain constraints also take integers (assigning variables to the
integer value) and integer sets of type
\gecoderef[class]{IntSet}. For example,
\begin{code}
IntArgs a(4, 1,-3,5,-7)
IntSet d(a);
dom(home, x, d);
\end{code}
constrains the variable \?x? (or, the variables in \?x?) to take
values from the set $\{-7,-3,1,5\}$
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{domain,in,in_interval,in_intervals,in_set}{dom}{TaskModelIntDomain}}.

Note that there are no domain constraints for Boolean variables,
please use relation constraints instead, see
\autoref{sec:m:integer:rel:bool}.

Domain constraints for a single variable also support
reification. For examples using domain constraints, see
\gecoderef[example]{knights:KnightsReified} and
\gecoderef[example]{perfect-square}.


\subsection{Membership constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:member}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntMember} constrain integer or
Boolean variables to be included in an array of integer or
Boolean variables. That is, for an integer variable array \?x? and an
integer variable \?y?, the constraint
\begin{code}
member(home, x, y);
\end{code}
forces that \?y? is included in \?x?:
$$
\mathtt{y}\in\left\{\mathtt{x}_0,\ldots,\mathtt{x}_{|\mathtt{x}|-1}\right\}
$$

As mentioned, \?x? and \?y? can also be Boolean variables.
Membership constraints also support reification.

% \CAT[int]{-}{member}{TaskModelIntMember}


\subsection{Simple relation constraints over integer variables}
\label{sec:m:integer:rel:int}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\quad}l@{\qquad}l@{\quad}l}
\?IRT_EQ? & equality ($=$) &
\?IRT_NQ? & disequality ($\neq$) \\
\?IRT_LE? & strictly less inequality ($<$) &
\?IRT_LQ? & less or equal inequality ($\leq$) \\
\?IRT_GR? & strictly greater inequality ($>$) &
\?IRT_GQ? & greater or equal inequality ($\geq$)
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Integer relation types}
\label{fig:m:integer:irt}
\end{figure}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntRelInt} enforce relations between
integer variables and between integer variables and integer
values. The relation depends on an integer relation type
\?IntRelType?  (see \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntRelInt}).
\autoref{fig:m:integer:irt} lists the available integer relation
types and their meaning.

\paragraph{Binary relation constraints.}

Assume that \?x? and \?y? are integer variables. Then
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_LE, y);
\end{code}
constrains \?x? to be strictly less than \?y?. Similarly, by
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_NQ, 4);
\end{code}
\?x? is constrained to be different from \?4?. Both variants of
\?rel? also support reification 
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{eq,neq,lt,leq,gt,geq}{rel}{TaskModelIntRelInt}}.

\paragraph{Constraints between variable arrays and a single
  variable.}

If \?x? is an integer variable array and \?y? is an integer
variable, then
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_LQ, y);
\end{code}
constrains all variables in \?x? to be less than or equal to
\?y?. Likewise,
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_GR, 7);
\end{code}
constrains all variables in \?x? to be larger than \?7?
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{arith}{rel}{TaskModelIntRelInt}}.

\paragraph{Constraints between array elements.}

If \?x? is an integer variable array, then
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_LQ);
\end{code}
constrains the variables in \?x? to be sorted in
increasing order as follows:
$$
\mathtt{x}_0 \leq \mathtt{x}_1 \leq \cdots \leq
\mathtt{x}_{|\mathtt x|-1}
$$
The integer relation type values for inequalities (that is,
\?IRT_LE?, \?IRT_GQ?, and \?IRT_GR?) are analogous.  For an
example, see \autoref{chap:c:golomb} and
\gecoderef[example]{golomb-ruler}.

\begin{samepage}
By
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_EQ);
\end{code}
all variables in the integer variable array \?x? are constrained to be
equal:
$$
\mathtt{x}_0 = \mathtt{x}_1 = \cdots =
\mathtt{x}_{|\mathtt x|-1}
$$
\end{samepage}

By
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_NQ);
\end{code}
the variables in \?x? are constrained to be not all equal:
$$
\neg\left(\mathtt{x}_0 = \mathtt{x}_1 = \cdots =
\mathtt{x}_{|\mathtt x|-1}\right)
$$
For an example, see \gecoderef[example]{schurs-lemma}
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{all_equal,decreasing,increasing,not_all_equal,strictly_decreasing,strictly_increasing}{rel}{TaskModelIntRelInt}}.

\paragraph{Lexicographic constraints between variable arrays.}

\begin{samepage}
If \?x? and \?y? are integer variable arrays (where the sizes of
\?x? and \?y? can be different),
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_LE, y);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
constrains \?x? and \?y? such that \?x? is lexicographically
strictly smaller than \?y? (analogously for the other inequality
relations). For \?IRT_EQ? and $|\mathtt
x|=|\mathtt y|$, it is propagated that $\mathtt
x_i=\mathtt y_i$ for $0\leq i<|\mathtt x|$. For \?IRT_NQ? and $|\mathtt
x|=|\mathtt y|$, it
is propagated that $\mathtt x_i\neq \mathtt y_i$ for at least one
$i$ such that $0\leq
i<|\mathtt x|$. If $|\mathtt
x|\neq|\mathtt y|$, for \?IRT_EQ? the space \?home? is failed
whereas for \?IRT_NQ? the constraint is ignored
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{lex_greater,lex_greatereq,lex_less,lex_lesseq}{rel}{TaskModelIntRelInt}}.

See \gecoderef[example]{bibd} for an example
(albeit over Boolean variables).



\subsection{Simple relation constraints over Boolean variables}
\label{sec:m:integer:rel:bool}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\quad}l@{\qquad}l@{\quad}l}
\?BOT_AND? & conjunction ($\wedge$) &
\?BOT_OR?  & disjunction ($\vee$) \\
\?BOT_IMP? & implication ($\rightarrow$) &
\?BOT_EQV? & equivalence ($\leftrightarrow$) \\
\?BOT_XOR? & exclusive or ($\nleftrightarrow$) 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Boolean operation types}
\label{fig:m:integer:bot}
\end{figure}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntRelBool} include the same post
functions as simple relation constraints over integer variables.
In addition, simple relation constraints over Boolean constraints
provide support for the typical Boolean operations such as
conjunction and disjunction. Boolean operations are defined by
values of the type \?BoolOpType? (see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntRelInt}).
\autoref{fig:m:integer:bot} lists the available Boolean operation
types.

For example, for Boolean variables \?x?, \?y?, and \?z?,
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, BOT_AND, y, z);
\end{code}
posts the constraint
$\mathtt{x}\wedge\mathtt{y}=\mathtt{z}$. Similarly,
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, BOT_OR, y, 1);
\end{code}
posts that $\mathtt{x}\vee\mathtt{y}$ must be true
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{and,equivalent,imply,or,xor}{rel}{TaskModelIntRelBool}}.

Note that
the integer value must be either zero or one, otherwise an
exception of type \gecoderef[class]{Int::NotZeroOne} is thrown.

For an example, see \gecoderef[example]{bibd}.

\tip{Boolean negation}{%
Boolean negation can be easily obtained by using
\?IRT_NQ? as relation type. The constraint
$\mathtt{x}=\neg\mathtt{y}$ for Boolean variables \?x? and \?y?
can be posted by
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_NQ, y);
\end{code}
}


\begin{samepage}
Additional constraints are available for Boolean variable arrays.
For a Boolean variable array \?x? and a Boolean variable \?y?,
\begin{code}
rel(home, BOT_OR, x, y)
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
posts the constraint
$$\bigvee_{i=0}^{|\mathtt x|-1}\mathtt{x}_i=\mathtt{y}$$ 
Again, \?y? can
also be \?0? or \?1?.

Note that Boolean implication is special in that it is not
associative and Gecode follows normal notational convention.
Hence for a Boolean variable array \?x? and a Boolean variable
\?y?,
\begin{code}
rel(home, BOT_IMP, x, y)
\end{code}
posts the constraint
$$\mathtt{x}_0 \to \left(\mathtt{x}_1 \to 
\left(\ldots\to\left(\mathtt{x}_{|\mathtt{x}|-2}\to 
\mathtt{x}_{|\mathtt{x}|-1}\right)\right)\right)=\mathtt{y}$$ 
Again, \?y? can
also be \?0? or \?1?.


\begin{samepage}
In order to avoid many propagators for negation, the clause
constraint accepts both positive and negative Boolean variables.
For Boolean variable arrays \?x? and \?y? and a Boolean variable
\?z?  (again, \?z? can also be \?0? or \?1?)
\begin{code}
clause(home, BOT_AND, x, y, z);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
posts the constraint
$$\bigwedge_{i=0}^{|\mathtt{x}|-1}\mathtt{x}_i\wedge
\bigwedge_{i=0}^{|\mathtt{y}|-1}\neg\mathtt{y}_i=\mathtt z$$ 
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{clause_and,clause_or,nand,nor}{clause}{TaskModelIntRelBool}}.

Note that only \?BOT_AND? and \?BOT_OR? as Boolean operation
types are supported, other Boolean operations types throw an
exception of type \gecoderef[class]{Int::IllegalOperation}. 

For an example, see \gecoderef[example]{sat}.

\label{sec:m:integer:arithmetic}

&\YES&&\CAT[int]{-}{divmod}{TaskModelIntArith}
\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption[Arithmetic constraints]{Arithmetic constraints (\?x?, \?y?, \?z?,
  \?d?, and \?m? are integer variables; \?n? is an integer)}
\label{fig:m:integer:arithmetic}
\end{figure}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntArith} exist only over integer
variables. In addition to the constraints summarized in
\autoref{fig:m:integer:arithmetic} (bnd abbreviates bounds
consistency and dom abbreviates domain consistency), the minimum and maximum
constraints are also available for integer variable arrays. That
is, for an integer variable array \?x? and an integer variable
\?y?
\begin{code}
min(home, x, y);
\end{code}
constrains \?y? to be the minimum of the variables in \?x?
(\?max? is analogous). 

\subsection{Linear constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:linear}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntLI} and
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntLB} provide essentially the
same post functions for integer and Boolean constraints (to be
discussed below). The most general variant
\begin{code}
linear(home, a, x, IRT_EQ, c);
\end{code}
posts the linear constraint
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{|\mathtt x|-1} \mathtt{a}_i \cdot \mathtt{x}_i =
\mathtt c
$$
with integer coefficients \?a? (of type \?IntArgs?), integer
variables \?x?, and an integer constant \?c?. Note that \?a? and
\?x? must have the same size. Of course, all other integer
relation types are supported, see \autoref{fig:m:integer:irt} for a
table of integer relation types. Multiple occurrences of the same
variable in \?x? are explicitly allowed and common terms $a\cdot
y$ and $b\cdot y$ for the same variable $y$ are rewritten to
$(a+b)\cdot y$ to increase propagation. For an example, see
\autoref{sec:m:started:first}.

\begin{samepage}
The array of coefficients can be omitted if all coefficients are
one. That is,
\begin{code}
linear(home, x, IRT_GR, c);
\end{code}
posts the linear constraint
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{|\mathtt x|-1} \mathtt{x}_i > \mathtt c
$$
for a variable array \?x? and an integer \?c?.
\end{samepage}

Instead of an integer constant \?c? as the right-hand side of the
linear constraint, an integer variable can be used as well. This
is true for linear constraints over both integer and Boolean
variables: the right-hand side is always an integer value or an
integer variable, even if the left-hand side involves Boolean
variables.  For example, when assuming that \?x? is an array of
Boolean variables,
\begin{code}
linear(home, x, IRT_GQ, y);
\end{code}
imposes the constraint that there are at least \?y? ones among
the Boolean variables in \?x?.

All variants of \?linear? support reification and exist in
variants that perform both bounds propagation (the default) and
domain propagation
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{scalar_product,sum_ctr}{linear}{TaskModelIntLI}}.
% TaskModelIntLB has been dropped for simplicity

\subsection{Distinct constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:distinct}

The \?distinct? constraint (see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntDistinct}) enforces that integer
variables take pairwise distinct values (also known as
\?alldifferent? constraint). Obviously, \?distinct? does not exist
for Boolean variables.

\begin{samepage}
Posting
\begin{code}
distinct(home, x);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
constrains all variables in \?x? to be pairwise different.

\begin{samepage}
Posting
\begin{code}
distinct(home, c, x);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
for an array of integer values \?c? (of type \?IntArgs?) and an array
of integer variables \?x? of same size, constrains the variables
in \?x? such that
$$\mathtt{x}_i+\mathtt{c}_i \neq\mathtt{x}_j+\mathtt{c}_j 
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq i,j< |\mathtt{x}|\mbox{ and }i\neq j
$$

Gecode offers value (the default), bounds (based
on~\cite{distinctbnd}), and domain propagation (based
on~\cite{Regin94}) for \?distinct?
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{alldifferent,alldifferent_cst}{linear}{TaskModelIntDistinct}}.

For examples, see in particular \autoref{chap:c:golomb},
\gecoderef[example]{queens}, and
\gecoderef[example]{crowded-chess}.



\subsection{Counting constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:count}

\paragraph{Counting single values.}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntCount} count how often values are
taken by an array of integer variables. The simplest case is
\begin{code}
count(home, x, y, IRT_EQ, z);
\end{code}
which constrains \?z? to be equal (controlled by \?IRT_EQ?, all
integer relation types are supported, see
\autoref{fig:m:integer:irt}) to the number of integer variables in
\?x? that are equal to \?y?. Here \?y? and \?z? can be
integer variables as well as integer values
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{atleast,atmost,count,exactly}{count}{TaskModelIntCount}}.

The \?count? constraints also support counting how many integer variables
are included in an integer set. If \?y? is an integer set, then
\begin{code}
count(home, x, y, IRT_EQ, z);
\end{code}
constrains \?z? to be equal to the number of integer variables in
\?x? that are included in \?y?
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{among,among_var,counts}{count}{TaskModelIntCount}}.

The following
\begin{code}
count(home, x, c, IRT_EQ, z);
\end{code}
where \?x? is an array of integer variables and \?c? is an array
of integers (of type \?IntArgs?) with same size and \?z? is an
integer variable or value, constrains \?z? to how often
$\mathtt{x}_i=\mathtt{c}_i$, that is
$$
\mathtt{z}=\#\setc{i\in\{0,\ldots,|\mathtt{x}|-1\}}{\mathtt{x}_i=\mathtt{c}_i}
$$
Here, $\#s$ denotes the cardinality (number of elements) of a set
$s$.

% \CAT[int]{-pairwise equal counting}{count}{TaskModelIntCount}

\paragraph{Counting multiple values.}

The \?count? constraint also supports counting multiple values
(also known as gcc, or \emph{g}lobal \emph{c}ardinality
\emph{c}onstraint). Suppose that \?x? and \?y? (the
\emph{counting variables}) are two integer variable arrays (not
necessarily of the same size). Then
\begin{code}
count(home, x, y);
\end{code}
posts the constraints that the number of variables in \?x? that
are equal to a value $j$ is $\mathtt{y}_j$ (for $0\leq j<|\mathtt
y|$):
$$
\#\setc{i\in\{0,\ldots,|\mathtt{x}|-1\}}{\mathtt{x}_i=j}=\mathtt{y}_j
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq j<|\mathtt{y}|
$$
and that no other values are taken by \?x?:
$$
\bigcup_{i=0}^{|\mathtt{x}|-1} \{\mathtt{x}_i\} =
\{0,\ldots,|\mathtt y|-1\}
$$
Rather than using counting variables, one can also use an array
of integer sets (\?IntSetArgs?). Then the number of values taken
must be included in each individual set.

A more general variant also takes into account that the values
under consideration are non contiguous but are defined by an
additional array of integer values. Suppose that \?x? and \?y?
(the counting variables) are two integer variable arrays (not
necessarily of the same size) and \?c? is an array of integers
with the same size as \?y?. 

\begin{samepage}
Then,
\begin{code}
count(home, x, y, c);
\end{code}
posts the constraints that the number of variables in \?x? that
are equal to the value $\mathtt{c}_j$ is $\mathtt{y}_j$ (for
$0\leq j<|\mathtt y|$):
$$
\#\setc{i\in\{0,\ldots,|\mathtt{x}|-1\}}{\mathtt{x}_i=\mathtt{c}_j}
=\mathtt{y}_j
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq j<|\mathtt{y}|
$$
and that no other values but those in \?c? are taken by \?x?:
$$
\bigcup_{i=0}^{|\mathtt{x}|-1} \{\mathtt{x}_i\} =
\bigcup_{i=0}^{|\mathtt{c}|-1} \{\mathtt{c}_i\}
$$
Again, \?y? can also be an array of integer sets, where equality
$=$ is replaced by set inclusion $\in$.
\end{samepage}

A slightly simpler variant replaces the cardinality variables by
a single integer set. That is, for an array of integer variables
\?x?, an integer set \?d?, and an array of integer values \?c?
\begin{code}
count(home, x, d, c);
\end{code}
posts the constraints that the number of variables in \?x? that
are equal to the value $\mathtt{c}_j$ is included in $\mathtt{d}$
(for $0\leq j<|\mathtt c|$):
$$
\#\setc{i\in\{0,\ldots,|\mathtt{x}|-1\}}{\mathtt{x}_i=\mathtt{c}_j}
   \in\mathtt{d}
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq j<|\mathtt{c}|
$$
and that no other values but those in \?c? are taken by \?x?:
$$
\bigcup_{i=0}^{|\mathtt{x}|-1} \{\mathtt{x}_i\} =
\bigcup_{i=0}^{|\mathtt{c}|-1} \{\mathtt{c}_i\}
$$

The last variant of \?count? clarifies that \?count? is a
generalization of \?distinct? (see
\autoref{sec:m:integer:distinct}): \?distinct? constrains a value
to occur at most once, whereas \?count? offers more flexibility
to constrain which values and how often these values can occur.

\begin{samepage}
For example, if we know that the variables in the variable array
\?x? take values between \?0?  and \?n-1?, then
\begin{code}
count(home, x, IntSet(0,1), IntArgs::create(n,0,1));
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
is equivalent to
\begin{code}
distinct(home, x);
\end{code}


Counting constraints only support integer variables, \?linear?
constraints can be used for Boolean variables, see
\autoref{sec:m:integer:linear}. For examples, see the
case studies in \autoref{chap:c:magicsequence} and
\autoref{chap:c:warehouses} or 
the examples \gecoderef[example]{crowded-chess} and 
\gecoderef[example]{magic-sequence}.


Note that Gecode implements the semantics of the original paper
on the global cardinality constraint by
R{\'e}gin~\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/Regin96}, where no other values
except those specified may occur. This differs from the semantics
in the Global Constraint Catalog~\cite{GlobalConstraintCatalog},
where values that are not mentioned can occur arbitrarily often. 

Gecode offers value (the default), bounds (based
on~\cite{gccbnd}), and domain propagation (based
on~\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/Regin96}) for the global \?count?
constraint
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{global_cardinality}{count}{TaskModelIntCount}}.


\subsection{Number of values constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:nvalues}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntNValues} constrain how many values
can be taken by an array of variables. 

Assume that \?x? is an array of integer variables and \?y? is an
integer variable. Then
\begin{code}
nvalues(home, x, IRT_EQ, y);
\end{code}
constrains the number of distinct values in \?x? to be equal to
\?y?, that is
$$
\#\{\mathtt{x}_0,\ldots,\mathtt{x}_{|\mathtt{x}|-1}\}=\mathtt y
$$

Instead of \?IRT_EQ? any other integer relation type can be used,
see \autoref{fig:m:integer:irt} for an overview. For example,
\begin{code}
nvalues(home, x, IRT_LQ, y);
\end{code}
constrains the number of distinct values in \?x? to be less than
or equal to \?y?. The array \?x? can also be an array of Boolean
variables and \?y? can be an integer value.

The constraint is implemented by the propagators introduced
in~\cite{nvalue}
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{nvalue,nvalues}{nvalues}{TaskModelIntNValues}}. 
For an example using the \?nvalues? constraint,
see \gecoderef[example]{dominating-queens}.




\subsection{Sequence constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:sequence}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntSequence} constrain how often
values are taken by repeated subsequences of variables in an
array of integer or Boolean variables. By
\begin{code}
sequence(home, x, s, q, l, u);
\end{code}
where \?x? is an array of integer or Boolean variables, \?s? is an integer set, and \?q?, \?l?, and \?u? are integers, all
subsequences of length \?q? in the variable array \?x?, that is,
the sequences
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\langle \mathtt{x}_0,\ldots,\mathtt{x}_{\mathtt{q}+0-1} \rangle\\
\langle \mathtt{x}_1,\ldots,\mathtt{x}_{\mathtt{q}+1-1} \rangle\\
\cdots\\
\langle \mathtt{x}_{|\mathtt{x}|-\mathtt{q}},\ldots,\mathtt{x}_{|\mathtt{x}|-1} \rangle\\
\end{array}
$$
are constrained such that at least \?l? and at most \?u?
variables in each subsequence are assigned to values
from the integer set \?s?.

In more mathematical notation, the constraint enforces
$$
\bigwedge_{i=0}^{|\mathtt{x}|-\mathtt{q}} 
       \operatorname{among}(\langle
       \mathtt{x}_i,\ldots,\mathtt{x}_{i+\mathtt{q}-1}\rangle,
       \mathtt{s},\mathtt{l},\mathtt{u})
$$
where the $\operatorname{among}$ constraint for the subsequence
starting at position $i$ is defined as
$$
  l\leq\#\{j\in\{i,\ldots,i+\mathtt{q}-1\}\;|\;x_j\in \mathtt{s}\} \leq u
$$

The constraint is implemented by the domain consistent propagator
introduced in~\cite{DBLP:journals/constraints/HoevePRS09}
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{among_seq}{sequence}{TaskModelIntSequence}}. For an
example, see \gecoderef[example]{car-sequencing}.




\subsection{Channel constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:channel}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntChannel} channel Boolean to integer
variables and integer variables to integer variables.

\paragraph{Channeling integer variables.}

For two integer variable arrays \?x? and \?y? of same size,
\begin{code}
channel(home, x, y);
\end{code}
posts the constraint
$$\mathtt{x}_i=j\iff\mathtt{y}_j=i
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq i,j<|\mathtt x|
$$
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{inverse}{channel}{TaskModelIntChannel}}.
The \?channel? constraint between two integer variable arrays
also supports integer offsets. For integers \?n? and \?m?,
\begin{code}
channel(home, x, n, y, m);
\end{code}
posts the constraint
$$\mathtt{x}_i-\mathtt n=j\iff\mathtt{y}_j-\mathtt m=i
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq i,j<|\mathtt x|
$$
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{inverse_offset}{channel}{TaskModelIntChannel}}.
For examples, see \gecoderef[example]{knights:KnightsReified} and \gecoderef[example]{black-hole}.



\paragraph{Channeling between integer and Boolean variables.}

As integer and Boolean variables are unrelated (see
\autoref{sec:m:integer:var}), the only way to express that a
Boolean variable \?x? is equal to an integer variable \?y? is by
posting either
\begin{code}
channel(home, x, y);
\end{code}
\begin{samepage}
or
\begin{code}
channel(home, y, x);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}

The \?channel? constraint can also map an integer variable \?y?
to an array of Boolean variables \?x?. The constraint
$$\mathtt{x}_i=1 \iff \mathtt y = i\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq i<|x|$$
is posted by
\begin{code}
channel(home, x, y);
\end{code}
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{domain_constraint}{channel}{TaskModelIntChannel}}.
Note that an optional offset argument is supported. The constraint
$$\mathtt{x}_i=1 \iff \mathtt y = i+\mathtt n\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq i<|x|$$
for an integer value \?n? is posted by
\begin{code}
channel(home, x, y, n);
\end{code}
For an example, see \gecoderef[example]{pentominoes}.





\subsection{Element constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:element}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntElement} generalize array access
to integer variables. For example,
\begin{code}
IntArgs c(5, 1,4,9,16,25);
element(home, c, x, y);
\end{code}
constrains the integer variable \?y? to be the element of the
array \?c? at index \?x? (where the array starts at index \?0? as is
common in \CPP{}).

The index variable \?x? is always an integer variable, but the
array \?c? can also be an array of integer variables, Boolean
variables, or an array of integers between \?0? and \?1?. The
result variable \?y? must be a Boolean variable or an integer
between \?0? and \?1? if the array is an array of Boolean
variables. It can be a Boolean variable if all integer values in
the array are between \?0? and \?1?.

Even if bounds propagation is requested for the \?element?
constraint, the propagators for \?element? always perform domain reasoning
on the index variable
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{elem,element}{element}{TaskModelIntElement}}.
For examples, see the case study in
\autoref{chap:c:warehouses} or the examples
\gecoderef[example]{steel-mill} and \gecoderef[example]{tsp}.



\tip{Shared integer arrays}{
\label{tip:m:integer:sharedelement}%
When checking the documentation for
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntElement} it might come at a surprise that
element constraints do not take integer argument arrays of type
\?IntArgs?  but \emph{shared integer arrays} of type
\?IntSharedArray? as argument. The reason is that the
very same shared integer array can be used for several element
constraints.

Consider the following example
\begin{code}
IntArgs c(5, 1,4,9,16,25);
element(home, c, x, y);
element(home, c, a, b);
\end{code}
where \?x?, \?y?, \?a?, and \?b? are integer variables. Then,
each time an element constraint is posted, a new shared integer
array is created implicitly (that is, in the example above, two
arrays are created). If the integer array is large or many
element constraints are posted, it is beneficial to
explicitly create a shared integer array, such as in:
\begin{code}
IntArgs c(5, 1,4,9,16,25);
IntSharedArray cs(c);
element(home, cs, x, y);
element(home, cs, a, b);
\end{code}
Here only a single shared arrays is created and is used for both
propagators created for posting the element constraints.

What is also obvious from the first example is that integer
argument arrays of type \?IntArgs? can automatically be coerced
to integer shared arrays of type \?IntSharedArray?. Hence, if
performance is not that important, you even do not need to know
that shared integer arrays exist.

For an example that uses shared integer arrays together with
element constraints, see \autoref{chap:c:crossword} and
\gecoderef[example]{crossword}.
}

\tip{Shared arrays also provide STL-style iterators}{
Shared arrays also support STL-style (Standard Template Library)
iterators, similar to other arrays provided by Gecode, see
\autoref{sec:m:integer:stl}.
}

\subsection{Extensional constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:extensional}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntExt} (also known as user-defined or
ad-hoc constraints) provide constraints that are specified in
\emph{extension}. The extension can be either defined by a
\gecoderef[class]{DFA} (deterministic finite automaton) or a
tuple set \gecoderef[class]{TupleSet}. DFAs can also be specified
conveniently by regular expressions, see \autoref{sec:m:minimodel:reg}.

Note that both DFAs and tuple sets are proper Gecode
data structures. When storing a DFA or a tuple set as
a space member, the member must be updated with an
\?update? function during cloning exactly as described for
variables in \autoref{sec:m:integer:update}.\footnote{In most cases,
  the data structure is actually shared between spaces created by
  cloning. Only when a non-shared clone is requested (for
  parallel search), a copy of the data structure is created. This
  is the reason why updating is required.}

\paragraph{Deterministic finite automata.}

Suppose we want to plan the activities of an evening that follows
the Swedish drinking protocol: you may have as many drinks as you
like, but now and then you sing a song after which you have to
have a drink. We want to constrain an array of activities
(Boolean or integer variables) such that the activities (drinking
and singing) follow the protocol.

\begin{figure}
\newcommand{\STATE}[1]{\circlenode{#1}{$\strut #1$}}
\newcommand{\ASTATE}[1]{\circlenode{#1}{$\strut$}}
\newcommand{\FSTATE}[1]{\circlenode[doubleline=true]{#1}{$\strut #1$}}
\newcommand{\AFSTATE}[1]{\circlenode[doubleline=true]{#1}{$\strut$}}
\newcommand{\SSTATE}{\circlenode[linecolor=white]{start}{\white$\strut 0$}}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c@{\qquad}c@{\qquad\qquad}c}
\\\\\\
\SSTATE & \FSTATE{0} & \STATE{1}
\\\\
\end{tabular}
\ncline[nodesep=2pt]{->}{start}{0}%
\ncarc[arcangleA=30,arcangleB=30]{->}{0}{1}\Aput{\?1?}%
\ncarc[arcangleA=30,arcangleB=30]{->}{1}{0}\Aput{\?0?}%
\nccircle{->}{0}{.6}\Bput{\?0?}%
\end{center}
\caption{A DFA for the Swedish drinking protocol}
\label{fig:m:integer:dfa}
\end{figure}

The DFA in \autoref{fig:m:integer:dfa} specifies legal sequences of
activities according to the Swedish drinking protocol, where the
state $0$ is the start state and also the final state. The
symbol \?0? corresponds to drinking, whereas \?1? corresponds to
singing. That is, the sequence of activities must be a string of
\?0?s and \?1?s accepted by the DFA.

\begin{samepage}
The \gecoderef[class]{DFA} \?d? is initialized by
\begin{code}
DFA::Transition t[] = {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 1},
                       {1, 0, 0}, {-1, 0, 0}};
int f[] = {0,-1};
DFA d(0, t, f);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
The array of transitions \?t? is initialized by triples of
integers (of type \gecoderef[class]{DFA::Transition}). A triple
$\{a,s,b\}$ defines a transition from state $a$ to state $b$ with
symbol $s$. States are denoted by non-negative integers and
symbols are integer values (as always, restricted to integer
values that can be taken on by an integer variable, see
\autoref{sec:m:integer:limits}). A transition where $a$ is $-1$
marks the last transition in a transition array. The array of
final states \?f? lists all final states of the DFA, where the
array is terminated by $-1$. The first argument of the
constructor of the DFA defines the start state.

Constraining an array of variables for four activities to the
Swedish drinking protocol is done by
\begin{code}
BoolVarArray x(home, 4, 0, 1);
extensional(home, x, d);
\end{code}
Note that the same DFA would also work with an array of integer
variables.

The propagator for the \?extensional? constraint is domain
consistent and is based on~\cite{Pesant:CP:2004}.

Examples that use regular expressions for defining DFAs can
be found in \autoref{sec:m:minimodel:reg}.

% \CAT[int]{-regular}{extensional}{TaskModelIntExt}

\paragraph{Tuple sets.}

Constraints can also be defined by a list of tuples, where each
tuple defines one solution of the extensional constraint. For
example, the following defines the Swedish drinking protocol for
three activities by a list of tuples:
\begin{code}
TupleSet t;
t.add(IntArgs(3, 0,0,0));
t.add(IntArgs(3, 0,1,0));
t.add(IntArgs(3, 1,0,0));
t.finalize();
\end{code}
Note that before a tuple set can be used by a post function, it
must be finalized as shown above. If a not-yet finalized tuple
set is used for posting a constraint, an exception of type
\gecoderef[class]{Int::NotYetFinalized} is thrown.

The propagators for the \?extensional? constraint are domain
consistent and are based on~\cite{gacschema} and~\cite{gac2001}
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{in_relation}{extensional}{TaskModelIntExt}}.

Constraining a sequence of variables to the Swedish drinking
protocol using a tuple set is done by
\begin{code}
BoolVarArray x(home, 3, 0, 1);
extensional(home, x, t);
\end{code}
For examples of extensional constraints using tuple sets, see
\autoref{chap:c:kakuro}, 
\gecoderef[example]{black-hole}, and \gecoderef[example]{kakuro}.



\subsection{Sorted constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:sorted}

\begin{samepage}
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntSorted} relate an integer variable
array to an array obtained by sorting the array. For example,
\begin{code}
sorted(home, x, y);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
constrains \?y? to be \?x? (of same size) sorted in increasing
order. The more general variant features an additional integer
variable array (again, of same size) \?z? as in
\begin{code}
sorted(home, x, y, z);
\end{code}
where \?z? defines the sorting permutation, that is
$$
\mathtt{x}_i=\mathtt{y}_{\mathtt{z}_i}
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq i<|\mathtt x|
$$

The propagator for \?sorted? is bounds consistent and is based
on~\cite{MehlhornThiel:CP:2000}
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{sort,sort_permutation}{sorted}{TaskModelIntSorted}}.

\subsection{Bin-packing constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:bpp}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntBinPacking} constrain how items
can be packed into bins. The bin-packing constraint is posted as
\begin{code}
binpacking(home, l, b, s);
\end{code}
where \?l? is an array of integer variables (the \emph{load}
variables), \?b? is an array of integer variables (the \emph{bin}
variables), and \?s? is an array of non-negative integers (the item
\emph{sizes}). 

The load variables \?l? determine the load $\mathtt{l}_j$ of each
bin~$j$ ($0\leq j<|\mathtt{l}|$) and the bin variables~\?b?
determine for each item~$i$ ($0\leq i<|\mathtt{b}|$) into which
bin~$\mathtt{b}_i$ it is packed. The size of an item~$i$ ($0\leq
i<|\mathtt{b}|$) is defined by its item size $\mathtt{s}_i$.
Naturally, the number of bin variables and item sizes must
coincide ($|\mathtt{b}|=|\mathtt{s}|$).

The bin-packing constraint enforces that
all items are packed into bins
$$
\mathtt{b}_i\in\{0,\ldots,|\mathtt{l}|-1\}
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq i<|\mathtt{b}|
$$
and that the load of each bin corresponds to the items packed
into it
$$
\mathtt{l}_j=\sum_{\setc{i\in\{0,\ldots,|\mathtt{b}|-1\}}%
{\mathtt{b}_j=i}} \mathtt{s}_i
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq j<|\mathtt{l}|
$$

The constraint is implemented by the propagator introduced
in~\cite{Shaw:CP:2004}
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{bin_packing,bin_packing_capa}{binpacking}{TaskModelIntBinPacking}}.
For an example using the bin-packing
constraint and CDBF (complete decreasing best fit)~\cite{CDBF} as
a specialized branching for bin-packing, see
\autoref{chap:c:bpp} and
\gecoderef[example]{bin-packing}.




\subsection{Geometrical packing constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:geopacking}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntGeoPacking} constrain how
rectangles can be packed such that no two rectangles from a
collection of rectangles overlap.

If \?x? and \?y? are integer variable arrays and \?w? and \?h?
are integer arrays (where all arrays must be of the same size),
then
\begin{code}
nooverlap(home, x, w, y, h);
\end{code}
propagates that the rectangles defined by coordinates $\langle
\mathtt x_i,\mathtt y_i\rangle$, widths $\mathtt w_i$, and
heights $\mathtt h_i$ for $0\leq i<|\mathtt x|$ do not
overlap. That is, the following constraint is enforced (see also
\autoref{sec:m:minimodel:bool} for a picture):
$$
\left(\mathtt{x}_i+\mathtt{w}_i\leq \mathtt{x}_j\right) \vee
\left(\mathtt{x}_j+\mathtt{w}_j\leq \mathtt{x}_i\right) \vee
\left(\mathtt{y}_i+\mathtt{h}_i\leq \mathtt{y}_j\right) \vee
\left(\mathtt{y}_j+\mathtt{h}_j\leq \mathtt{y}_i\right)
$$

Note that the width or the height of a rectangle can be zero. In
this case, the rectangle does not occupy any space. However no
other rectangle is allowed to be placed where the zero-sized
rectangle is placed.

Rectangles can also be modeled as optional through a Boolean
variable $\mathtt m_i$ for each rectangle $i$. If the Boolean
variable $\mathtt{m}_i$ is \?1? the rectangle is mandatory and
considered by the packing constraint, if it is \?0?, the
rectangle is ignored. 

\begin{samepage}
With an array of Boolean variables \?m? the
constraint taking optional rectangles into account is posted by
\begin{code}
nooverlap(home, x, w, y, h, m);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}

The arrays defining the dimensions (that is, \?w? and \?h? for
rectangles) can also be arrays of integer variables, where its
values are constrained to be non-negative. In this case, the
constraint post functions expects both a start and end
coordinate. That is, by posting
\begin{code}
nooverlap(home, x0, w, x1, y0, h, y1);
\end{code}
it is enforced that the rectangles defined by the start
coordinate $\langle \mathtt{x0}_i,\mathtt{y0}_i\rangle$, the
dimension $\langle \mathtt{w}_i,\mathtt{h}_i\rangle$, and the
end coordinate $\langle \mathtt{x1}_i,\mathtt{y1}_i\rangle$ do
not overlap. The end coordinates are \emph{not} constrained to
be the sum of the start coordinates and dimensions. That is, one
has to explicitly post the linear constraints such that
$$
\left(\mathtt{x0}_i+\mathtt{w}_i=\mathtt{x1}_i\right)\wedge
\left(\mathtt{y0}_i+\mathtt{h}_i=\mathtt{y1}_i\right)
$$

The constraints are implemented by a naive propagator (considering
pairwise no-overlap between rectangles including
constructive disjunction, see also \GCCATNAME:
\CAT[int]{diffn}{nooverlap}{TaskModelIntGeoPacking}),
 this will change in the future.  For
an example using the no-overlap constraint, see
\gecoderef[example]{perfect-square}.

\caption{Representing edges and propagating \?circuit?}
\label{fig:m:integer:circuit}
\end{figure}

The \?circuit? and \?path? constraints (see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntGraph}) use values of
variables in an integer variable array \?x? as edges: if
$j\in\mathtt{x}_i$, the corresponding graph contains the
edge $i\to j$ for $0\leq i,j<|\mathtt{x}|$. Obviously, the graph
has the nodes $0$ to $|\mathtt{x}|-1$. 

\paragraph{Circuit constraints.}

Assume that \?x? is an integer variable array
(\?circuit? does not support Boolean variables). Then,
\begin{code}
circuit(home, x);
\end{code}
constrains the values of \?x? such that their corresponding edges form
a Hamiltonian circuit
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{circuit}{circuit}{TaskModelIntGraph}}.
For an example before and after
propagation of \?circuit? see \autoref{fig:m:integer:circuit}.  For
an example, see \autoref{chap:c:knights} and \gecoderef[example]{knights:KnightsCircuit}.



Common applications of \?circuit? also require costs for the
edges in the graph. Assume that the cost for an edge $i\to j$
from node $i$ to node $j$ is defined by the
following matrix:
$$
\begin{array}{|c|rrrr|}
\hline
i\to j&\cdot\to 0&\cdot\to 1&\cdot\to 2&\cdot\to 3\\
\hline
0\to\cdot & 0 & 3 & 5 & 7\\
1\to\cdot & 4 & 0 & 9 & 6\\
2\to\cdot & 2 & 1 & 0 & 5\\

\caption{Representing edges and propagating \?circuit? with cost}
\label{fig:m:integer:costcircuit}
\end{figure}


Then, by
\begin{code}
IntArgs c(4*4, 0, 3, 5, 7,
               4, 0, 9, 6,
               2, 1, 0, 5,
              -7, 8,-2, 0);
circuit(home, c, x, y, z);
\end{code}
the integer variables \?x? are constrained to the values forming
the circuit as above, while the integer variables \?y? define the
cost of the edge for each node (these variables can be omitted),
and the integer variable \?z? defines the total cost of the edges
in the circuit. Note that the matrix interface as described in
\autoref{sec:m:minimodel:matrix} might come in handy for setting up
the cost matrix.


\autoref{fig:m:integer:costcircuit} shows a simple example for
propagation \?circuit? with cost where the cost matrix from above
is used.  For an example, see \gecoderef[example]{tsp}.

\paragraph{Hamiltonian path constraints.}

The \?path? constraint (see \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntGraph})
is similar to the \?circuit? constraint and enforces that nodes
in a graph from a Hamiltonian path. Assume that \?x? is an
integer variable array (\?path? does not support Boolean
variables) and \?s? (for start) and \?e? (for end) are integer
variables. Then,
\begin{code}
path(home, x, s, e);
\end{code}
constrains the values of \?x?, \?s?, and \?e? such that their
corresponding edges form a Hamiltonian path that starts at node
$\mathtt{x}_{\mathtt{s}}$ and ends at node
$\mathtt{x}_{\mathtt{e}}$ (the value of the variable
$\mathtt{x}_{\mathtt{e}}$ is always $|\mathtt{x}|$).

As an example, assume that the integer variable array \?x? has three
elements (that is, $|\mathtt{x}|=3$) with values between $0$ and
$3$. Then all solutions to 
\begin{code}
path(home, x, s, e);
\end{code}
are as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\?x? & \?s? & \?e? \\
\hline\hline
$\langle\mathtt 1, \mathtt 2, \mathtt 3\rangle$ & $\mathtt 0$ & $\mathtt 2$
\\\hline
$\langle\mathtt 1, \mathtt 3, \mathtt 0\rangle$ & $\mathtt 2$ & $\mathtt 1$
\\\hline
$\langle\mathtt 2, \mathtt 0, \mathtt 3\rangle$ & $\mathtt 1$ & $\mathtt 2$
\\\hline
$\langle\mathtt 2, \mathtt 3, \mathtt 1\rangle$ & $\mathtt 0$ & $\mathtt 1$
\\\hline
$\langle\mathtt 3, \mathtt 0, \mathtt 1\rangle$ & $\mathtt 2$ & $\mathtt 0$
\\\hline
$\langle\mathtt 3, \mathtt 2, \mathtt 0\rangle$ & $\mathtt 1$ &
$\mathtt 0$
\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The \?path? constraint provides, similar to \?circuit?, variants
for costs for edges in a Hamiltonian path, see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntGraph}.



\subsection{Scheduling constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:scheduling}

This section provides an overview of scheduling constraints.

\begin{important}
  The support for scheduling constraints is still experimental.
  It is not yet complete, as it still lacks modeling abstractions
  and specialized branchings. The existing code is tested and
  efficient, but the interfaces may change in future
  versions.
\end{important}

\subsubsection{Unary resource constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:unary}

A unary resource constraint models that a number of tasks to be
executed on a single resource do not overlap, where each task is
defined by its start time (an integer variable), its duration
(an integer or integer variable), and possibly its end time (if the duration 
is a variable). Unary resource constraints are also known as
disjunctive scheduling constraints.

For example, assume that four tasks with durations \?2?, \?7?,
\?4?, and \?11? are to be executed on the same resource where the
start times are specified by an array of integer variables (of
course, with four variables). Then, posting
\begin{code}
IntArgs d(4, 2,7,4,11);
unary(home, s, d);
\end{code}
constrains the start times in \?s? such that the execution of
none of the tasks overlaps in time (see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntScheduling}).

All propagators implementing \?unary? use
overload-checking, detectable precedences, not-first-not-last,
and edge-finding, following~\cite{Vilim:2007}
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{disjunctive}{unary}{TaskModelIntScheduling}}.

A common variant for unary resource constraints is where tasks
can be optional: each task $t$ has a Boolean variable $b$
attached to it. If $b=1$ then the task is \emph{mandatory} and
is scheduled on the resource. If $b=0$ then the task is
\emph{excluded} and is not scheduled. Otherwise, the task is said
to be \emph{optional}. Assume that \?b? refers to an array of
Boolean variables also of size \?4?, then
\begin{code}
IntArgs d(4, 2,7,4,11);
unary(home, s, d, b);
\end{code}
posts a propagator that constrains the start times \?s? (of
course, only if a task is mandatory) as well the Boolean
variables in \?b? (if a task becomes excluded as otherwise no
feasible schedule would exist).

\paragraph{Tasks with flexible duration.}

The duration of a task can also be given as an integer variable
instead of a constant integer. In this case, we say that the
tasks are \emph{flexible}. In addition to the flexible duration,
the \?unary? constraint also requires variables for the end time
of each task.

Given variable arrays \?s?, \?d?, and \?e? for the start times,
durations, and end times, a unary resource constraint is posted
as
\begin{code}
unary(home, s, d, e);
\end{code}
However, the additional constraint for each task $i$ that
$\texttt{s}[i]+\texttt{d}[i]=\texttt{e}[i]$ is not enforced
automatically. Therefore, a model typically must contain
additional constraints like
\begin{code}
for (int i=0; i<s.size(); i++)
  post(home, s[i]+d[i]==e[i]);
\end{code}

The \?unary? post function also exists in a variant with
flexible, optional tasks.

\subsubsection{Cumulative scheduling constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:cumulatives}

Gecode provides two generalizations of the unary resource
scheduling constraint. The first one, called \?cumulative?,
models a resource where tasks can overlap. The resource has a
limited \emph{capacity}, and each task requires a certain
\emph{resource usage}. At each point in time, the sum of the
resource usages of all tasks running at that point must not
exceed the capacity. The second generalization, called
\?cumulatives?, deals with several cumulative resources at once.

\paragraph{Cumulative single-resource constraint.}

The single-resource constraint \?cumulative? has nearly the same
interface as \?unary?. The only difference is a parameter \?c?
specifying the resource capacity, and an additional integer array
\?u? for the resource usage of each task. Assuming that \?s? and
\?d? give the start times and durations as before, the following
models a resource where two tasks can overlap, and the first
three tasks require one unit of the resource, while the last task
requires two:
\begin{code}
IntArgs u(4, 1,1,1,2);
cumulative(home, 2, s, d, u);
\end{code}
The capacity can be an integer variable or a nonnegative integer.
The resource usage must be stricly
positive. As for unary, there exist versions with optional,
flexible, and flexible and optional tasks.

The propagators implementing the \?cumulative? constraint use
time-tabling, overload checking~\cite{Vilim:CPAIOR:2009}, and
edge-finding~\cite{Vilim:CP:2009}
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{cumulative}{cumulative}{TaskModelIntScheduling}}.

\paragraph{Cumulative multi-resource constraint.}

Given a \emph{set} of resources that have some specified
usage limit and a set of tasks that must be placed on these
resources according to start-times, durations, resource usage,
and resource compatibility, the \?cumulatives? constraint (see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntScheduling}) can be
used for the placement of these tasks. The limit for the
resources can be either a maximum or a minimum, and the resource
usage of a task can be positive, negative, or zero. The limit is
only valid over the intervals where there is at least one task
assigned on that particular resource.

Consider the following code.
\begin{code}
cumulatives(home, resource, start, duration, end, height, 
            limit, atmost);
\end{code}
This code posts a constraint over a set of tasks $T$, where each
task $T_i$
is defined by $\langle \mathtt{resource}_i, \mathtt{start}_i,
\mathtt{duration}_i, \mathtt{end}_i, \mathtt{height}_i \rangle$. The
\?resource? component indicates the potential resources that the task can
use; \?start?, \?duration?, and \?end? indicate when the task can occur; and
finally the \?height? component indicates the amount of resource the
task uses (or ``provides'' in the case of a negative value). The
resource $R_i$ is defined by the limit $\mathtt{limit}_i$ and the
parameter \?atmost?. The latter is common for all resources, and
indicates whether the limits are maximum limits (\?atmost? is true) or
minimum limits (\?atmost? is false).

As for flexible tasks in \autoref{sec:m:integer:unary}, the \?cumulatives?
constraint does not enforce that
$\mathtt{start}_i+\mathtt{duration}_i=\mathtt{end}_i$. This additional
constraint must be posted manually.

The parameters \?start? and \?end? are always integer variable
arrays; \?resource?, \?duration?, and \?height? can be either
integer variable arrays or integer arrays; and \?limit? is always an
array of integers.

For an example using \?cumulatives? see
\gecoderef[example]{perfect-square}, where the \?cumulatives?
constraints is used to model packing a set of squares. For an
insightful discussion of how to use \?cumulatives? for modeling,
see~\cite{DBLP:conf/cp/BeldiceanuC02} (the propagator for
\?cumulative? is implemented following this paper,
see also \GCCATNAME:
\CAT[int]{cumulatives}{cumulatives}{TaskModelIntScheduling}).


\subsection{Value precedence constraints}
\label{sec:m:integer:precede}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntPrecede} enforce that a value
precedes another value in an array of integer variables. By
\begin{code}
precede(home, x, s, t);
\end{code}
where \?x? is an array of integer variables and both \?s? and
\?t? are integers, the following is enforced: if there exists $j$
($0\leq j<|\mathtt{x}|$) such that $\mathtt{x}_j=\mathtt{t}$,
then there must exist $i$ with $i<j$ such that
$\mathtt{x}_i=\mathtt{s}$. This is equivalent to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathtt{x}_0 \neq \mathtt t$, and
\item if $\mathtt{x}_j=\mathtt t$ then $\bigvee_{i=0}^{j-1}
  \mathtt{x}_i=\mathtt s$ for $1\leq j<|\mathtt x|$.
\end{enumerate}

A generalization is available for precedences between several
integer values. By
\begin{code}
precede(home, x, c);
\end{code}
where \?x? is an array of integer variables and \?c? is an array
of integers, it is enforced that $\mathtt{c}_i$ precedes
$\mathtt{c}_{i+1}$ in \?x? for $0\leq i<|\mathtt c|-1$. That is
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathtt{x}_0 \neq \mathtt{c}_{k+1}$ for $0\leq k<|\mathtt{c}|-1$, and
\item if $\mathtt{x}_j=\mathtt{c}_{k+1}$ then $\bigvee_{i=0}^{j-1}
  \mathtt{x}_i=\mathtt{c}_k$ for $1\leq j<|\mathtt x|$ and $0\leq
  k<|\mathtt{c}|-1$.
\end{enumerate}

The constraint is implemented by the domain consistent propagator
introduced in~\cite{Precede}
\GCCAT{\CAT[int]{int_value_precede,int_value_precede_chain}{precede}{TaskModelIntPrecede}},
the paper also explains how to use
the \?precede? constraint for breaking value symmetries.
For an example, see \gecoderef[example]{schurs-lemma}.




\section{Synchronized execution}
\label{sec:m:integer:exec}

Gecode offers support in
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntExec} for executing a function
(either a function or a static member function but not a member
function) when integer or Boolean variables become assigned. 

\begin{samepage}
Assume that a function \?c? (for continuation) is defined by
\begin{code}
void c(Space& home) { ... }
\end{code}
Then
\begin{code}
wait(home, x, &c);
\end{code}
posts a propagator that waits until the integer or Boolean
variable \?x? (or, if \?x? is an array of variables: all variables in
\?x?) is assigned. If \?x? becomes assigned, the function \?c? is
executed with the current home space passed as argument.
\end{samepage}

\tip{Failing a space}{%
If you want to fail a space \?home? (for example when executing a
continuation function as discussed above), you can do that by
\begin{code}
home.fail();
\end{code}
}

Assume that
two functions \?t? (for then) and \?e? (for else) are defined by
\begin{code}
void t(Space& home) { ... }
void e(Space& home) { ... }
\end{code}
Then
\begin{code}
when(home, x, &t, &e);
\end{code}
creates a propagator that will be run exactly once when the
Boolean variable \?x?  becomes assigned. If \?x? becomes assigned
to \?1?, the function \?t?  is executed. If \?x? becomes assigned
to \?0?, the function \?e?  is executed. Both functions get the
current home space of the propagator passed as argument. The
else-function is optional and can be omitted.

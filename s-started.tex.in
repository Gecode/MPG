\chapter{Getting started}
\label{chap:s:started}

This chapters presents how to implement simple search engines.
The focus is on understanding the basic operations available on
spaces to implement search engines. None of the engines presented
here is realistic as they do not use recomputation. The full
picture is developed in \autoref{chap:s:re} and
\autoref{chap:s:engine}.

\paragraph{Overview.}

\mbox{}\autoref{sec:s:started:space} sets the stage by explaining
space operations for programming search engines. A 
depth-first search engine that makes the simplifying assumption
that all choices explored during search are binary is shown in
\autoref{sec:s:started:dfsbin}. The next section,
\autoref{sec:s:started:dfs}, shows depth-first search for choices
with an arbitrary number of alternatives. How best solution
search can be programmed from spaces is exemplified by a simple
branch-and-bound search engine in \autoref{sec:s:started:bab}.



\section{Space-based search}
\label{sec:s:started:space}

Search engines compute with spaces: a space implements a
constraint model and exploration of its search space is
implemented by operation on spaces. The operations on spaces
include: computing the status of a space by the \?status()?
function, creating a clone of a space by the \?clone()? function,
and committing to an alternative of a choice by the \?commit()?
function. To commit to an alternative, a space provides the
function \?choice()? that returns a choice defining how the space
can be committed to one of its alternatives. Another operation
required to program exploration is the function \?alternatives()?
defined by a choice that returns the number of alternatives of a
choice.

Spaces implement also a \?constrain()? function for best solution
search. Its discussion is postponed to
\autoref{sec:s:started:bab}.

This section reviews the above operations from the perspective of a
search engine, the perspective how branchers are controlled by
these operations is detailed in
\autoref{sec:b:started:overview}. Gecode's architecture for
search is designed such that a search engine does not need to
know \emph{which} problem is being solved by a search engine: any
problem implemented with spaces can be solved by a search engine,
and different search engines can be used for solving the same
problem. The basic idea of this factorization is due to
\cite{Schulte:LNAI:2002}. 

Note that here and in the following, spaces and choices are
always assumed to be \emph{pointers} to the respective objects.
Pointers are necessary as search engines dynamically create and
delete spaces and choices.

\paragraph{Status computation.}

A search engine needs to decide how to proceed during search by
computing the \emph{status} of a space by invoking its
\?status()? function. The \?status()? function performs
constraint propagation (see \autoref{sec:p:started:solving})
followed by determining the next brancher for branching, if
possible (see \autoref{sec:b:started:overview}). Depending on the
result of constraint propagation and brancher selection, the
\?status()? function returns one of the following values of the
type \?SpaceStatus? (see \gecoderef[group]{TaskSearch}):
\begin{itemize}
\item \?SS_FAILED?: the space is \emph{failed}. The search engine
  needs to backtrack and revisit other spaces encountered
  during exploration.

  An important responsibility of a search engine is to perform
  resource management for spaces. In the case of failure, the
  typical action is to delete the failed space.
\item \?SS_SOLVED?: the space is \emph{solved}. Hence the search
  engine has found a solution and typically returns the
  solution. 
  
  For most engines, the responsibility for deleting a solution
  lies with the user of a search engine.

  Following the discussion in \autoref{par:b:started:gc}, calling
  the \?choice()? function of a solved space performs garbage
  collection for branchers that are not any longer
  needed. \autoref{sec:s:started:dfsbin} shows an example search
  engine that performs garbage collection on solved spaces.
\item \?SS_BRANCH?: the space requires branching for search to
  proceed. 
  
  The first step in branching is to compute a choice by calling
  the \?choice()? function of a space. The returned choice can be
  used for committing to alternatives of a space. In particular,
  a choice returned by the \?choice()? function provides a
  function \?alternatives()?  that returns how many alternatives
  the choice has.
  
  The pointer to the choice that is returned by the \?choice()?
  function of a space \?s? is \?const?. That is, the following
  code:
\begin{smallcode}
const Choice* ch = s->choice();
\end{smallcode}
gets a \?const? pointer to a choice (the choice cannot be
modified). Note that it is the obligation of the search engine to
eventually delete the choice by
\begin{smallcode}
delete ch;
\end{smallcode}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cloning spaces.}

A central requirement for a search engine is that it can return
to a previous state: as spaces constitute the nodes of the search
tree, a previous state is nothing but a space again.  Returning
to a previous space might be necessary because an alternative
suggested by a branching did not lead to a solution, or, even if
a solution has been found, more solutions might be requested.

As propagation and branching modify spaces, provisions must be
taken that search can actually return to the clone of a previous space. This
is provided by the \?clone()? function of a space: it returns a
clone of a space. This clone can be stored by a search engine
such that the engine can return to a previous state. Spaces that are
clones of each other are \emph{equivalent}: space operations will
have exactly the same effect on equivalent spaces.

The \?clone()? function of a space can only be called on a space
that is stable and not failed (that is, the \?status()? function
on a space must return \?SS_SOLVED? or \?SS_BRANCH?). Otherwise,
Gecode throws an exception of type
\gecoderef[class]{SpaceNotStable} if the space is not stable and
of type \gecoderef[class]{SpaceFailed} if the space is failed.


\paragraph{Committing to alternatives.}

Given a space \?s? and a choice \?ch? (assumed to be a \?const?
pointer), the space \?s? can be committed to the \?i?-th
alternative by calling the \?commit()?  function of a space as
follows:
\begin{code}
s->commit(*ch,i);
\end{code}
The choice \?ch? must be \emph{compatible} with the space \?s?.
Before defining when a choice is compatible with a space, let us
look at two examples. 

Suppose a search engine has invoked \?status()? on a space \?s?
which returned \?SS_BRANCH?. The next step is to obtain a
choice \?ch? for \?s? and a clone \?c? of \?s? by:
\begin{code}
const Choice* ch = s->choice();
Space* c = s->clone();
\end{code}
Further assume that the choice is binary (that is,
\?ch->alternatives()? returns \?2?). A search engine can explore
both alternatives (typically, the search engine performs the
\?commit()? for the second\footnote{Even though the alternatives are
  numbered starting from \?0? we refer to the alternative
  with number \?0? as the first alternative and the alternative
  with number \?1? as the second alternative.} alternative much
later) by:
\begin{code}
s->commit(*ch,0);
c->commit(*ch,1);
\end{code}
That is, a choice \?ch? is compatible with the space \?s? from
which it has been computed and with the clone \?c? of \?s?.

A search engine for best solution search performs slightly
different operations. Let us follow an example scenario. First,
the search engine starts exploring the first
alternative by:
\begin{code}
s->commit(*ch,0);
\end{code}
Then search continues with \?s?. Let us assume that the search engine
finds a better solution when continuing search from \?s?. Hence,
the search engine adds additional constraints to the clone \?c?
to make sure that exploration from \?c? yields a better solution
(the constraints are added by calling the \?constrain()?
function of a space, see \autoref{sec:s:started:bab}). And only
then the search engine commits the clone \?c? to the second
alternative by:
\begin{code}
c->commit(*ch,1);
\end{code}
That is, a choice \?ch? is also compatible with the clone \?c? of
\?s?, even though additional constraints have been added to \?c?
after it had been created by cloning.

In fact, the relation that a choice is compatible with a space is
quite liberal. The full notion of compatibility is needed for
recomputation and is discussed in 
\autoref{sec:s:re:compatible}. 


\paragraph{Parallel search.}

Gecode's kernel is constructed such it does not need to know
anything about parallelism: it performs no
synchronization\footnote{That is a slight over-simplification.
  Gecode's kernel performs just enough synchronization to
  maintain global information such as AFC (see
  \autoref{sec:m:search:branch:int}).} in order to keep
propagation and search simple and efficient.

By default, a space or clones of a space can only be used by a
single thread. However, one can request clones that can be used
by different threads as they are created independently. This is
achieved by providing \?false? as an additional argument to the
\?clone()?  member function as follows:
\begin{code}
Space* c = s->clone(false);
\end{code}
The additional argument requests that a non-shared clone is
created (in fact, it requests that non-shared copies of data
structures used by the space \?s? are created, see
\autoref{sec:p:memory:shared} for details). The spaces \?s? and
\?c? can now be used by different threads in parallel.

\paragraph{Statistics support.}

The three main space operations (\?status()?, \?clone()?, and
\?commit()?) provide support for execution
statistics. For example, statistics from
the execution of \?status()? on a space \?s? can be collected in
the object \?stat? by:
\begin{code}
StatusStatistics stat;
s->status(stat);
\end{code}
The classes for the statistics correspond to the space
operations:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\qquad}l}
\?status()? & \gecoderef[class]{StatusStatistics}\\
\?clone()? & \gecoderef[class]{CloneStatistics}\\
\?commit()? & \gecoderef[class]{CommitStatistics}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Statistics information is collected by accumulation. That is, for spaces
\?s1? and \?s2?, the following:
\begin{code}
StatusStatistics stat;
s1->status(stat);
s2->status(stat);
\end{code}
collects the combined statistics of performing \?status()? on
\?s1? and \?s2?. 

\begin{samepage}
The statistics classes also implement addition operators. The
following is equivalent to the previous example:
\begin{code}
StatusStatistics stat;
{
  StatusStatistics a, b;
  s1->status(a);
  s2->status(b);
  stat = a + b;
}
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
which is also equivalent to:
\begin{code}
StatusStatistics stat;
{
  StatusStatistics a, b;
  s1->status(a); stat += a;
  s2->status(b); stat += b;
}
\end{code}



\section{Binary depth-first search}
\label{sec:s:started:dfsbin}

This section shows a simple search engine that performs left-most
depth-first search. It makes the additional simplification that
all choices are binary, the general case is
discussed in \autoref{sec:s:started:dfs}.

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{dfs binary}
\caption{Depth-first search for binary choices}
\label{fig:s:started:dfsbin}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:s:started:dfsbin} shows the definition of the function
\?dfs()? that implements the search engine. It takes a space as
input and returns a space as a solution or \?NULL? if no
solution exists. The resource policy it implements is that it
takes responsibility for deleting the space \?s? with which
\?dfs()? is called initially. The solution it returns must
eventually be deleted by the caller of \?dfs()?  (if
the initial space happens to be a solution, the engine does not
delete it).
The search engine starts by executing the \?status()?  function
on \?s? and hence triggers propagation and possibly brancher
selection.

In this chapter and in \autoref{chap:s:re} we use recursive
functions to implement exploration during search. This is rather
inefficient with respect to both runtime and space in \CPP{}. A
more realistic implementation uses an explicit stack, for an
example see \autoref{chap:s:engine}.

\paragraph{Failure and solutions.}

In case the space \?s? is failed, the search engine deletes the space
and returns \?NULL? as specified:
\insertlitcode{dfs binary:failed}

\begin{samepage}
If the space \?s? is solved, the search engine triggers garbage
collection of remaining branchers as mentioned in
\autoref{sec:s:started:space} and returns the solution:
\insertlitcode{dfs binary:solved}
\end{samepage}

\paragraph{Branching.}

Following the discussion in \autoref{sec:s:started:space}, before
the search engine can start committing to alternatives and perform
recursive search, it needs to compute a choice for committing and
a clone for backtracking:
\insertlitcode{dfs binary:prepare for branching}

The search engine tries the first alternative by committing the
space \?s? to it and continues search recursively:
\insertlitcode{dfs binary:first alternative}
If the recursive call to \?dfs()? returns a solution (that is,
\?t? is different from \?NULL? and hence the condition of the \?if?
statement is \?true?) the engine deletes both choice and clone and returns
the solution~\?t?.

\paragraph{Saving memory.}

It is \emph{absolutely essential} that the search engine uses the
original space \?s? for further exploration and stores the clone
\?c? for backtracking. Exchanging the roles of \?s? and
\?c? by:
\begin{code}
c->commit(*ch,0);
if (Space* t = dfs(c)) {
  delete ch; delete s;
  return t;
}
\end{code}
would also find the same solution. However, this search engine
would most likely need
more memory. Spaces that already have been used for
propagation (such as \?s?) typically require more memory than a
pristine clone (see also \autoref{sec:p:memory:state}). 
Hence, any search engine should maintain the invariant that it
stores pristine clones for backtracking, but never spaces that
have been used for propagation.

If the first alternative did not lead to a solution, search
commits the clone \?c? to the second alternative,
deletes the now unneeded choice, and recursively continues search:
\insertlitcode{dfs binary:second alternative}


\section{Depth-first search}
\label{sec:s:started:dfs}

This section demonstrates how left-most depth-first search with
choices having an arbitrary number of alternatives can be
implemented. By this, the section presents the general version of
the search engine from \autoref{sec:s:started:dfsbin}.

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{dfs}
\caption{Depth-first search}
\label{fig:s:started:dfs}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:s:started:dfs} outlines the depth-first search
engine, where computing the space status and handling failed and
solved spaces is the same as in
\autoref{sec:s:started:dfsbin}. If the search engine needs to
branch, it computes the choice \?ch? for branching and the number
of alternatives \?n?.

Choices can actually have a single alternative, for example for
assigning variables (see
\autoref{sec:m:search:branch:assign}). This special case should
be optimized as in fact no clone needs to be stored for
backtracking. Hence:
\insertlitcode{dfs:single alternative}

\begin{samepage}
If the choice has more than a single alternative, a clone \?c? is
created and a loop iterates over all alternatives:
\insertlitcode{dfs:several alternatives}
\end{samepage}
If the loop terminates, no solution has been found and hence
\?NULL? is returned.

When trying the \?a?-th alternative, the search engine
determines which space \?e? to choose to continue
exploration:
\insertlitcode{dfs:space to explore}
The choice of \?e? avoids the creation of an unnecessary clone
for the last alternative.

After committing the space to explore the \?a?-th alternative,
search continues recursively. If a solution \?t? has been found,
it is returned after the search engine deletes the clone (unless it
has already been used for the last alternative) and the choice:
\insertlitcode{dfs:recursive search}


\section{Branch-and-bound search}
\label{sec:s:started:bab}

This section shows how to program a best solution search
engine. It chooses branch-and-bound search as an example where
choices are again assumed to binary for simplicity. The
non-binary case can be programmed similar to
\autoref{sec:s:started:dfs}.

\paragraph{Constraining spaces.}

A space to be used for best solution search must implement a
\?constrain()? function as discussed in
\autoref{sec:m:started:search-best}. The key aspect of a best
solution search engine is that it must be able to add constraints
to a space such that the space can only lead to solutions that
are better than a previously found solution.

Assume that a best solution search engine has found a so-far best
solution \?b? (a space). Then, by
\begin{code}
s->constrain(*b);
\end{code}
the engine can add constraints to the space \?s? that guarantee
that only solutions that are better than \?b? are found by search
starting from \?s?.

The \gecoderef[class]{Space} class actually already implements a
\?constrain()? function which throws the exception
\gecoderef[class]{SpaceConstrainUndefined}. That is, a space to
be used with a best solution search engine must redefine the
default \?constrain()? function by inheritance.

\paragraph{Search engine.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{bab}
\caption{Branch-and-bound search}
\label{fig:s:started:bab}
\end{figure}

The basic structure of the branch-and-bound search engine is
shown in \autoref{fig:s:started:bab}. A user of the search engine
calls the function \?bab()?  taking a single space as
argument. The function either returns the best solution or
\?NULL? if no solution exists.

The function \?bab()? that takes three arguments implements the
actual exploration. The space \?s? is the space that is currently
being explored, the unsigned integer \?n? counts the number of
solutions found so far, and the space \?b? is the so-far best
solution. Note that both \?n? and \?b? are passed by reference
and hence the variables are shared between all recursive
invocations of the search engine. The number of solutions \?n?
is used for deciding when a space must be constrained to yield
better solutions.

The single argument \?bab()? function initializes \?n? and \?b?
to capture that no solution has been found yet. After executing
the \?bab()? search engine, \?b? refers to the best solution (or
is \?NULL?) and is returned after garbage collecting remaining
branchers.

\paragraph{Finding a solution.}

The search engine is constructed such that every solution found
is better than the previous. Hence, when a solution is found, the
previous so-far best solution is deleted\footnote{Actually, \?b?
  is \?NULL? for the first solution found. However, it is legal
  in \CPP{} to invoke the \?delete? operator on a \?NULL?-pointer.}
and is updated to the newly found solution. As a new solution is
found also the number of solutions \?n? is incremented:
\insertlitcode{bab:solved}
The search engine first garbage collects branchers (by calling
\?choice()?) and remembers a pristine clone of the solution
found.

\paragraph{Branching.}

Exploring the first alternative differs considerably from
exploring the second alternative of a choice. When exploring the
first alternative, it is guaranteed that the current space \?s?
can only lead to better solutions. If a solution is found by
exploring the first alternative (or if several solutions are found),
then a constraint must be added to the clone \?c? such that only
better solutions can be found when continuing exploration with
\?c? for the second alternative. To detect whether a solution has been found when exploring
the first alternative, the search engine remembers the number of
solutions \?m?  before starting to explore the first alternative
as follows:
\insertlitcode{bab:remember number of solutions}

Exploring the first alternative is as to be expected:
\insertlitcode{bab:explore first alternative}

Before exploring the second alternative, the engine checks
whether new solutions have been found during the exploration of
the first alternative. If new solutions have been found, the
clone \?c? is constrained to yield better solutions:
\insertlitcode{bab:constrain clone}

\begin{samepage}
The second alternative is explored as follows:
\insertlitcode{bab:explore second alternative}
\end{samepage}

Note that execution of the \?constrain()? function might
constrain some variables and possibly add new propagators (even
new variables). Even though \?c? might not be any longer an
identical clone of \?s?, the choice \?ch? is still compatible
with the space \?c? (see \autoref{sec:s:started:space}).

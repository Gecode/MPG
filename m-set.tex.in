\chapter{Set variables and constraints}
\label{chap:m:set}

This chapter gives an overview over set variables and set
constraints in Gecode and serves as a starting
point for using set variables. For the reference documentation,
see \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSet}.

\paragraph{Overview.}

\mbox{}\autoref{sec:m:set:var} details how set variables can be
used for modeling.  The sections \autoref{sec:m:set:post} and
\autoref{sec:m:set:exec} provide an overview of the constraints
that are available for set variables in Gecode.

\begin{important}
Do not forget to add
\begin{code}
#include <gecode/set.hh>
\end{code}
to your program when you want to use set variables. Note that
the same conventions hold as in \autoref{chap:m:int}.
\end{important}

\section{Set variables}
\label{sec:m:set:var}

Set variables in Gecode model sets of integers and are instances
of the class \gecoderef[class]{SetVar}.

\tip{Still do not use views for modeling}{%
  Just as for integer variables, you should not feel tempted to
  use views of set variables (such as \?SetView?) for modeling.
  Views can only be used for implementing propagators and
  branchers, see \autoref{part:p} and \autoref{part:b}.
}

\paragraph{Representing set domains as intervals.}

The domain of a set variable is a set of sets of integers (in
contrast to a simple set of integers for an integer variable).
For example, assume that the domain of the set variable $x$ is
the set of subsets of $\{1,2,3\}$:
$$\big\{\;\{\},\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\}\;\big\}$$

Set variable domains can become very large -- the set
of subsets of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ has $2^n$ elements. Gecode (like
most constraint solvers) therefore approximates set variable
domains by a set interval $\range{l}{u}$ of a lower bound $l$ and an
upper bound $u$. The interval $\range{l}{u}$ denotes the set of sets
$\setc{s}{l\subseteq s\subseteq u}$. The lower bound $l$
(commonly referred to as greatest lower bound or \emph{glb})
contains all elements that are \emph{known} to be included in the
set, whereas the upper bound $u$ (commonly referred to as least
upper bound or \emph{lub}) contains the elements that \emph{may
  be} included in the set. As only the two interval bounds are
stored, this representation is space-efficient. The domain of $x$
from the above example can be represented as $\range{\{\}}{\{1,2,3\}}$.
  
Set intervals can only approximate set variable domains. For
example, the domain
$$\big\{\;\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{2,3\}\;\big\}$$
cannot be captured exactly by an interval. The closest interval
would be $\range{\{\}}{\{1,2,3\}}$. In order to get a closer
approximation of set variable domains, Gecode additionally stores
cardinality bounds. We write $\#\range{i}{j}$ to express that the
cardinality is at least $i$ and at most $j$. The set interval
bounds $\range{\{\}}{\{1,2,3\}}$ together with cardinality bounds
$\#\range{1}{2}$ represent the above example domain exactly.

\paragraph{Creating a set variable.}

New set variables are created using a constructor.
A new set variable \?x? is created by
\begin{code}
SetVar x(home, IntSet::empty, IntSet(1, 3), 1, 2);
\end{code}
This declares a variable \?x? of type \?SetVar? in the space
\?home?, creates a new set variable implementation with
domain $\range{\{\}}{\{1,2,3\}},\#\range{1}{2}$, and makes \?x?  refer to the newly
created set variable implementation.

There are several overloaded versions of the constructor, you can
for example omit the cardinality bounds if you do not want to
restrict the cardinality. You find the full interface in the
reference documentation of the class \gecoderef[class]{SetVar}.
An attempt to create a set variable with an empty domain throws
an exception of type \gecoderef[class]{Set::VariableEmptyDomain}.

As for integer and Boolean variables, the default and copy constructors do not create new variable implementations. Instead, the
variable does not refer to any variable implementation (default
constructor) or to the same variable implementation (copy
constructor). For example in
\begin{code}
SetVar x(home, IntSet::empty, IntSet(1, 3), 1, 2);
SetVar y(x);
SetVar z;
z=y;
\end{code}
the variables \?x?, \?y?, and \?z? all refer to the same set variable
implementation.

\paragraph{Limits for set elements.}

All set variable bounds are subsets of the \emph{universe}, defined as
$$\range{\mathtt{Set::Limits::min}}{\mathtt{Set::Limits::max}}$$
The universe is symmetric:
$-\mbox{\?Set::Limits::min?}=\mbox{\?Set::Limits::max?}$.
Furthermore, the cardinality of a set is limited to the unsigned integer interval
$$\#\range{0}{\mathtt{Set::Limits::card}}$$
The limits have been chosen
such that an integer variable can hold the cardinality.
This means that the maximal element of a set variable is
$\mathtt{Int::Limits::max} / 2 - 1$. The limits are defined in
the namespace \gecoderef[namespace]{Set::Limits}.

Any attempt to create a set variable with values outside the defined
limits throws an exception of type
\gecoderef[class]{Set::OutOfLimits}.

\tip{Small variable domains are still beautiful}{%
  Just like integer variables (see \autoref{tip:m:integer:beautifuldomains}), set 
  variables do not have a constructor that
  creates a variable with the largest possible domain. And again, one has to
  worry and the omission is deliberate to make you worry. So think about the 
  initial domains carefully when modeling.
}

\paragraph{Variable access functions.}

You can access the current domain of a set variable \?x? using member functions such as \?x.cardMax()?, returning the upper bound of the cardinality, or \?x.glbMin()?, returning the smallest element of the lower bound. Furthermore, you can print a set variable's domain using the standard output operator \?<<?.

\paragraph{Iterating variable domain interval bounds.}

For access to the interval bounds of a set variable, Gecode provides three value iterators and corresponding range iterators. For example, the
following loop 
\begin{code}
for (SetVarGlbValues i(x); i(); ++i)
  std::cout << i.val() << ' ';
\end{code}
uses the value iterator \?i? to print all values of the greatest lower
bound of the domain of \?x? in increasing order. If \?x? is assigned, this of course corresponds to the value of \?x?. Similarly, the following loop 
\begin{code}
for (SetVarLubRanges i(x); i(); ++i)
  std::cout << i.min() << ".." << i.max() << ' ';
\end{code}
uses the range iterator \?i? to print all ranges of the least upper bound of the domain of \?x?. The third kind of iterator, \gecoderef[class]{SetVarUnknownValues} or \gecoderef[class]{SetVarUnknownRanges}, iterate the values resp.\ ranges that are still unknown to be part or not part of the set, that is $u\setminus l$ for the domain $\range{l}{u}$.

\paragraph{When to inspect a variable.}

The same restrictions hold as for integer variables (see
\autoref{sec:m:integer:inspect}). The important restriction is
that one must not change the domain of a variable (for example,
by posting a constraint on that variable) while an iterator for
that variable is being used.

\paragraph{Updating variables.}

Set variables behave exactly like integer variables during cloning of a space. A set variable is updated by
\begin{code}
x.update(home, share, y);
\end{code}
where \?share? is the Boolean argument passed as argument to
\?copy()? and \?y? is the variable from which \?x? is to be
updated. While \?home? is the space \?x? belongs to, \?y? belongs
to the space which is being cloned.

\paragraph{Variable and argument arrays.}

Set variable arrays can be allocated using the class
\gecoderef[class]{SetVarArray}. The constructors of this class
take the same arguments as the set variable constructors,
preceded by
the size of the array. For example,
\begin{code}
SetVarArray x(home, 4, IntSet::empty, IntSet(1, 3));
\end{code}
creates an array of four set variables, each with domain $\range{\{\}}{\{1,2,3\}}$.

To pass temporary data structures as arguments, you can use the
\?SetVarArgs? class (see \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetArgs}).
Some set constraints are defined in terms of arrays of sets of
integers. These can be passed using \?IntSetArgs? (see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetArgs}). Set variable argument arrays 
support the same operations introduced in 
\autoref{sec:m:integer:args}.

\section{Constraint overview}
\label{sec:m:set:post}

This section introduces the different groups of constraints over
set variables available in Gecode. The section serves only as an
overview. For the details and the full list of available post
functions, the section refers to the relevant reference
documentation.

\paragraph{Reified constraints.}

Several set constraints also exist as a reified variant. Whether a reified
version exists for a given constraint can be found in the
reference documentation. If a reified version does exist, the
reification information combining the Boolean control variable and
an optional reification mode is passed as the last non-optional
argument, see \autoref{sec:m:integer:halfreify}.

\tip{Reification by decomposition}{%
\label{tip:m:set:rbd}%
If your model requires reification of a constraint for which no reified version exists in the library, you can often \emph{decompose} the reification. For example, to reify the constraint $\mbox{\?x?}\cup\mbox{\?y?}=\mbox{\?z?}$ to a control variable \?b?, you can introduce an auxiliary variable $\mbox{\?z0?}$ and post the two constraints
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, SOT_UNION, y, SRT_EQ, z0);
rel(home, z0, SRT_EQ, z, b);
\end{code}
}

\subsection{Domain constraints}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\quad}l@{\qquad}l@{\quad}l}
\?SRT_EQ? & equality ($=$) &
\?SRT_NQ? & disequality ($\neq$) \\
\?SRT_LQ? & lex. less than or equal &
\?SRT_LE? & lex. less than \\
\?SRT_GQ? & lex. greater than or equal &
\?SRT_GR? & lex. greater than\\
\?SRT_SUB? & subset ($\subseteq$) &
\?SRT_SUP? & superset ($\supseteq$) \\
\?SRT_DISJ? & disjointness ($\parallel$) &
\?SRT_CMPL? & complement ($\;\overline{\cdot}\;$)
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Set relation types}
\label{fig:m:set:srt}
\end{figure}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetDom} restrict the domain of a set variable using a
set constant (given as a single integer, an interval of two integers or an
\?IntSet?), depending on set relation types of type \?SetRelType? (see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSet}). \autoref{fig:m:set:srt} lists the available set
relation types and their meaning. The relations \?SRT_LQ?, \?SRT_LE?, \?SRT_GQ?, and \?SRT_GR? establish a total order based on the lexicographic order of the characteristic functions of the two sets.

\begin{samepage}
For example, the constraints
\begin{code}
dom(home, x, SRT_SUB, 1, 10);
dom(home, x, SRT_SUP, 1, 3);
dom(home, y, SRT_DISJ, IntSet(4, 6));
\end{code}
result in the set variable \?x? being a subset of
$\{1,\dots,10\}$ and a superset of $\{1,2,3\}$, while $4$, $5$,
and $6$ are not elements of the set $\mathtt{y}$. The domain constraints
for set variables support reification. Both \?x? and \?y? can
also be arrays of set variables where each array element is
constrained accordingly (but no reification is supported).
\end{samepage}

In addition to the above constraints,
\begin{code}
cardinality(home, x, 3, 5);
\end{code}
restricts the cardinality of the set variable \?x? to be between
$3$ and $5$. \?x?~can also be an array of set variables.

%\CAT[set]{-}{dom}{TaskModelSetDom}

For examples using domain constraints, see
\gecoderef[example]{crew}, as well as the redundant constraints
in \gecoderef[example]{golf}.

\subsection{Relation constraints}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetRel} enforce relations between set variables and between set and integer variables, depending on the set relation types introduced above.

For set variables \?x? and \?y?, the following constrains \?x? to
be a subset of \?y?:
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, SRT_SUB, y);
\end{code}

If \?x? is a set variable and \?y? is an integer variable, then
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, SRT_SUP, y);
\end{code}
constrains \?x? to be a superset of the singleton set
$\{\mathtt{y}\}$, which means that \?y? must be an element of \?x?.

\begin{samepage}
The last form of set relation constraint uses an integer relation
type (see \autoref{fig:m:integer:irt}) instead of a set relation
type. This constraint restricts \emph{all} elements of a set
variable to be in the given relation to the value of an integer
variable. For example,
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, IRT_GR, y);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
constrains all elements of the set variable \?x? to be strictly
greater than the value of the integer variable \?y?
\GCCAT{\CAT[set]{eq_set,in,in_set,not_in}{rel}{TaskModelSetRel}}.

Gecode provides reified versions of all set relation constraints. For an
example, see \gecoderef[example]{golf} and \autoref{chap:c:golf}.

\subsection{Set operations}
\label{m:set:set_operations}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\quad}l@{\qquad}l@{\quad}l}
\?SOT_UNION? & union ($\cup$) &
\?SOT_INTER? & intersection ($\cap$) \\
\?SOT_DUNION? & disjoint union ($\uplus$) &
\?SOT_MINUS? & set minus ($\setminus$)
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Set operation types}
\label{fig:m:set:sot}
\end{figure}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetRelOp} perform set operations
according to the type shown in \autoref{fig:m:set:sot} and relate
the result to a set variable. For example,
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, SOT_UNION, y, SRT_EQ, z);
\end{code}
enforces the relation $\mathtt{x}\cup \mathtt{y}=\mathtt{z}$ for
set variables \?x?, \?y?, and \?z?. For an array of set variables
\?x?,
\begin{code}
rel(home, SOT_UNION, x, y);
\end{code}
enforces the relation
$$\bigcup_{i=0}^{|\mathtt{x}|-1}\mathtt{x}_i=\mathtt{y}$$

Instead of set variables, the relation constraints also accept
\?IntSet?  arguments as set constants. There are no reified
versions of the set operation constraints (you can decompose
using reified relation constraints on the result, see
\autoref{tip:m:set:rbd}).

% \CAT[set]{-}{rel}{TaskModelSetRelOp}

Set operation constraints are used in most examples that contain
set variables, such as \gecoderef[example]{crew} or
\gecoderef[example]{hamming}.

\subsection{Element constraints}
\label{m:set:element}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetElement} generalize array access to
set variables.  The simplest version of \?element? for set
variables is stated as
\begin{code}
element(home, x, y, z);
\end{code}
for an array of set variables or constants \?x?, an integer
variable \?y?, and a set variable \?z?. It constrains \?z? to be
the element of array \?x? at index \?y? (where the index starts
at \?0?).

% \CAT[set]{-element}{element}{TaskModelSetElement}

A further generalization uses a \emph{set variable} as the index,
thus selecting several sets at once. The result variable is
constrained to be the union, disjoint union, or intersection of
the selected set variables, depending on the set operation type
argument. For example,
\begin{code}
element(home, SOT_UNION, x, y, z);
\end{code}
for set variables \?y? and \?z? and an array of set variables
\?x? enforces the following relation:
$$\mathtt{z}=\bigcup_{i\in\mathtt{y}}\mathtt{x}_i$$

Note that generalized element constraints follow the usual
semantics of set operations if the index variable is the empty
set: an empty union is the empty set, whereas an empty
intersection is the full universe. Because of this semantics, the
\?element? constraint has an optional set constant argument so
that you can specify the universe (i.e., usually the full set of
elements your problem deals with) explicitly. For an example of a
set element constraint, see \gecoderef[example]{golf} and \autoref{chap:c:golf}.

\subsection{Constraints connecting set and integer variables}
\label{m:set:set_int}

Most models that involve set variables also involve integer variables. In
addition to the set relation constraints that accept integer variables
(interpreting them as singleton sets), \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetConnect}
provide the necessary interface for models that use both set variables and
integer or Boolean variables.

The most obvious constraint connecting integer and set variables
is the cardinality constraint:
\begin{code}
cardinality(home, x, y);
\end{code}
It states that the integer variable \?y? is equal to the cardinality
of the set variable \?x?.

Gecode provides constraints for the minimal and maximal elements
of a set. The following code
\begin{code}
min(home, x, y);
\end{code}
constrains the integer variable \?y? to be the minimum of the set \?x?. 

% \CAT[set]{-cardinality,-min,-max}{cardinality,min,max}{TaskModelSetConnect}

For an example of constraints connecting integer and set
variables, see \gecoderef[example]{steiner}.

\paragraph{Weighted sets.}

The \?weights? constraint assigns a weight to each possible
element of a set variable \?x?, and then constrains an integer
variable \?y? to be the sum of the weights of the elements of
\?x?. The mapping is given using two integer arrays, \?e? and
\?w?. For example,
\begin{code}
IntArgs e(6,   1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9);
IntArgs w(6,  -1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 3);
weights(home, e, w, x, y);
\end{code}
enforces that \?x? is a subset of $\{1,3,4,5,7,9\}$ (the set of
elements), and that \?y? is the sum of the weights of the
elements in \?x?, where the weight of the element \?1? would be
\?-1?, the weight of \?3? would be \?4? and so on. Assigning \?x?
to the set $\{3,7,9\}$ would therefore result in \?y? being
assigned to $4+3+3=10$
\GCCAT{\CAT[set]{sum_set}{weights}{TaskModelSetConnect}}.

\subsection{Set channeling constraints}
\label{m:set:set_channel}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetChannel} link arrays of set variables, as well as
set variables with integer and Boolean variables.

For an two arrays of set variables \?x? and \?y?,
\begin{code}
channel(home, x, y);
\end{code}
posts the constraint
$$
j\in\mathtt{x}_i \Leftrightarrow i\in \mathtt{y}_j
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq i<|\mathtt{x}|
\qquad\mbox{and }0\leq j<|\mathtt{y}|
$$

For an array of integer
variables \?x? and an array of set variables \?y?,
\begin{code}
channel(home, x, y);
\end{code}
posts the constraint
$$
\mathtt{x}_i=j \Leftrightarrow i\in \mathtt{y}_j
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq i,j<|\mathtt{x}|
$$

The channel between a set variable \?y? and an array of Boolean
variables \?x?,
\begin{code}
channel(home, x, y);  
\end{code}
enforces the constraint
$$
\mathtt{x}_i=1 \Leftrightarrow i\in \mathtt{y}
\qquad\mbox{for }0\leq i<|\mathtt{x}|
$$

An array of integer variables \?x? can be channeled to a set
variable \?y? using
\begin{code}
rel(home, SOT_UNION, x, y);
\end{code}
which constrains \?y? to be the set $\{\mathtt{x}_0,\dots,\mathtt{x}_{|\mathtt{x}|-1}\}$. An alias for this constraint is defined in the modeling convenience library, see \autoref{sec:m:minimodel:channel} and \autoref{sec:m:minimodel:setalias}.

A specialized version of the previous constraint is
\begin{code}
channelSorted(home, x, y);
\end{code}
which constrains \?y? to be the set
$\{\mathtt{x}_0,\dots,\mathtt{x}_{|\mathtt{x}|-1}\}$, and the
integer variables in \?x? are sorted in increasing order
($\mathtt{x}_i<\mathtt{x}_{i+1}$ for $0\leq i<|\mathtt{x}|$)
\GCCAT{\CAT[set]{link_set_to_booleans}{channel}{TaskModelSetConnect}}.

%\CAT[set]{-int_set_channel}{channelSorted}{TaskModelSetConnect}

\subsection{Convexity constraints}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetConvex} enforce that set variables
are convex, which means that the elements form an integer
interval. For example, the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ is convex, while
$\{1,3,4,5\}$ is not, as it contains a hole. The \emph{convex
  hull} of a set $s$ is the smallest convex set containing $s$
($\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ is the convex hull of $\{1,3,4,5\}$).

The constraint
\begin{code}
convex(home, x);
\end{code}
states that the set variable \?x? must be convex, and
\begin{code}
convex(home, x, y);
\end{code}
enforces that the set variable \?y? is the convex hull of the set
variable \?x?.

%\CAT[set]{-convex}{convex}{TaskModelSetConvex}

\subsection{Sequence constraints}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetSequence} enforce an order among an
array of set variables \?x?. Posting the constraint
\begin{code}
sequence(home, x);
\end{code}
results in the sets \?x? being pairwise disjoint, and furthermore
$\max(\mathtt{x}_i)<\min(\mathtt{x}_{i+1})$ for all $0\leq
i<|\mathtt{x}|-1$. Posting
\begin{code}
sequence(home, x, y);
\end{code}
additionally constrains the set variable \?y? to be the union of the \?x?.

%\CAT[set]{-sequence}{sequence}{TaskModelSetSequence}

For an example of sequence constraints, see \gecoderef[example]{steiner}.

\subsection{Value precedence constraints}
\label{sec:m:set:precede}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetPrecede} enforce that a value
precedes another value in an array of set variables. By
\begin{code}
precede(home, x, s, t);
\end{code}
where \?x? is an array of set variables and both \?s? and
\?t? are integers, the following is enforced: if there exists $j$
($0\leq j<|\mathtt{x}|$) such that $s\notin\mathtt{x}_j$ and
$t\in\mathtt{x}_j$, then there must exist $i$ with $i<j$ such that
$s\in\mathtt{x}_i$ and $t\notin\mathtt{x}_i$.

A generalization is available for precedences between several
integer values. By
\begin{code}
precede(home, x, c);
\end{code}
where \?x? is an array of set variables and \?c? is an array
of integers, it is enforced that $\mathtt{c}_k$ precedes
$\mathtt{c}_{k+1}$ in \?x? for $0\leq k<|\mathtt c|-1$.


The constraint is implemented by the propagator
introduced in~\cite{Precede}
\GCCAT{\CAT[set]{set_value_precede}{precede}{TaskModelSetPrecede}}, 
the paper also explains how to use
the \?precede? constraint for breaking value symmetries.
For an example, see \gecoderef[example]{golf} and \autoref{chap:c:golf}.

\section{Synchronized execution}
\label{sec:m:set:exec}

Gecode offers support in
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelSetExec} for executing a function
(either a function or a static member function but not a member
function) when set variables become assigned. 

Assume that a function \?c? (for continuation) is defined by
\begin{code}
void c(Space& home) { ... }
\end{code}
Then
\begin{code}
wait(home, x, &c);
\end{code}
posts a propagator that waits until the set
variable \?x? (or, if \?x? is an array of variables: all variables in
\?x?) is assigned. If \?x? becomes assigned, the function \?c? is
executed with the current home space passed as argument.

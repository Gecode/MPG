\chapter{Getting started}
\label{chap:v:started}

This chapter outlines how a new variable type can be programmed
with Gecode. The chapter (and the entire part on programming
variables) chooses integer interval variables as its running
example.

\paragraph{Overview.}

An overview of what needs to be designed and programmed is
presented in \autoref{sec:v:started:overview}. The structure of
how the implementation of a variable type is organized is
presented in \autoref{sec:v:started:structure}.

\begin{important}
  Programming variables requires to configure and recompile
  Gecode from its source code. More details can be found in
  \autoref{chap:v:all}.
\end{important}


\section{Overview}
\label{sec:v:started:overview}

We are going to use \emph{integer interval variables} as the
running example for programming variables.
Integer interval variables take integer values (like the integer
variables that come pre-defined with Gecode do) but their domain
is defined by a lower and an upper bound only. That is, the
domain is always an interval. This is in contrast to the integer
variables that come with Gecode, where their domain can be any
finite set of integer values.

The focus of this part is on understanding what needs to be done
for implementing new variables, so we deliberately choose very
simple variables together with very few operations on them as an
example.

Even though integer interval variables seem not very interesting,
variants of them could in fact be interesting. For
example, the integer values used for the lower and upper bound
could be integers of arbitrary precision, or instead of integer
values one could choose floating point values.

\paragraph{What must be programmed.}

Programming variables includes the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Variable implementations} (\autoref{chap:v:varimp}):
  Programming a variable implementation consists of two tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first task is to specify domain-independent
  aspects of a variable implementation. This includes
  specifying a name for the variable implementation type, scope
  information, modification events, and propagation conditions.
  From a simple specification file containing this information a
  domain-independent base class for a variable implementation and
  the corresponding \CPP{} definitions of modification events and
  propagation conditions is generated.
  
  The generated base class together with the definition of
  modification events and propagation conditions actually become
  part of Gecode's kernel. The kernel needs these definitions to
  schedule propagators that have subscribed to a variable
  implementation and to maintain these subscriptions during
  cloning.
\item
The second task consists of programming the
  domain-dependent operations of a variable implementation. This
  is achieved by defining a class for a variable implementation
  that inherits from the generated, domain-independent base class
  and defines the respective domain operations.
\end{enumerate}
\item \emph{Variables} and \emph{variable arrays}
  (\autoref{chap:v:var}): As a variable is nothing but a simple
  and read-only interface to a variable implementation, a
  variable is obtained by inheriting from a base class for
  variables that depends on the variable implementation type. The
  actual programming amounts to defining read-only variable
  operations that invoke the corresponding operations on the
  variable's variable implementation.

  Variable arrays and variable argument arrays are, as variables,
  needed for modeling. Their programming requires the definition
  of several traits classes so that the defined arrays can be
  used with Gecode-provided functionality (for example, with the
  matrix interface for arrays, see
  \autoref{sec:m:minimodel:matrix}).
\item \emph{Views} (\autoref{chap:v:view}): Programming a view
  depends on the type of the view: whether the view is a direct
  interface to a variable implementation (a \emph{variable
    implementation view}), whether it is a \emph{constant view},
  or whether it is derived (a \emph{derived view}) from some
  other view. As examples, we are going to implement an integer
  view as a variable implementation view, minus and offset views
  as derived views, and an integer constant view as a constant
  view.
  
  In addition to the classes for views, some additional functions
  on views must be defined for testing in which order views are
  and whether two views are shared or the same (see
  \autoref{par:p:views:sameshared}).
\item \emph{Constraints} and \emph{branchings}: typically, when
  implementing variables one also needs to implement constraints
  and branchings for them.
  The implementation of constraints for a new variable type is
  not in any way different from what is described in
  \autoref{part:p}.
  
  The situation for implementing branchings is quite different:
  here one would want to offer at least a common set of
  variable-value branchings similar to those for integer variables
  (see \autoref{sec:m:branch:int}). Gecode offers substantial
  support for implementing variable-value branchings, including
  support for the specification of variable and value selection
  strategies, random and activity-based selection of variables,
  tie-breaking, filter functions, and much more. How
  to use Gecode's support for implementing variable-value
  branchings is detailed in \autoref{chap:v:branch}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Putting everything together.}

Even though we are presenting the implementation of integer
interval variables only as an example, \autoref{chap:v:all} shows
how everything is put together. This includes examples of
propagators, post functions using various views, and a
simple script (Golomb rulers, see \autoref{chap:c:golomb}) using
integer interval variables.

More importantly, it also shows how Gecode must be configured and
compiled such that integer interval variables are supported by
Gecode's kernel.


\section{Structure}
\label{sec:v:started:structure}

\begin{figure}[p]
\insertlitcode{int.hh}
\caption{The header file for integer interval variables}
\label{fig:v:started:header}
\end{figure}

The implementation of integer interval variables is contained in
a single header file \DOWNLOAD{int.hh}{\texttt{int.hh}}, which is
shown in \autoref{fig:v:started:header}. 

\paragraph{Namespaces.}

The implementation is contained in the namespace \?MPG? (for
\?M?odeling and \?P?rogramming with \?G?ecode) to avoid
name-clashes with functionality provided by Gecode. To keep the
implementation of integer interval variables concise, some important
definitions in the \?Gecode? namespace are made available by
\?using? declarations (see \autoref{fig:v:started:header}).

Similar to the organization of namespaces in Gecode, definitions
that are used for modeling (variables and variable arrays) are
contained in the namespace \?MPG?, while definitions that are
used for programming (variable implementations, views, branchers,
and additional support) are in the namespace \?MPG::Int?. As the
structure of namespaces matters (part of the support for variable
arrays must be defined inside the \?Gecode? namespace), each
program fragment is shown in its appropriate namespace.

\begin{samepage}
As an example, consider the definition of exceptions. Two are
thrown by the constructor of the integer interval
variable, in case the variable domain is ill-specified. The third
exception is thrown when the variable or value selection for a
branching is unknown:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:exceptions}
\end{samepage}

As discussed above, \?Exception? is \?Gecode::Exception? (see
\gecoderef[class]{Exception}) and has been introduced by a
\?using?  declaration.

\paragraph{Naming scheme.}

The naming scheme follows the same naming scheme for integer
variables as defined by Gecode (albeit defined in the
namespace \?MPG? instead of \?Gecode?):

\begin{itemize}
\item Variable implementations: The base class is named
  \?IntVarImpBase? whereas the variable implementation class is
  named \?IntVarImp?. The names of modification events start with
  \?ME_INT_? whereas the names of propagation conditions start
  with \?PC_INT_?. As mentioned above, these classes and
  identifiers are defined within the namespace \?MPG::Int?.
\item Variables and variable arrays: Integer interval variables
  are implemented by the class \?IntVar?. Variable arrays of
  integer interval variables are implemented by the class
  \?IntVarArray?, whereas the corresponding variable argument
  array is implemented by the class \?IntVarArgs?. These classes
  are defined in the namespace \?MPG?.
\item Views: the respective views are implemented by classes
  \?IntView?, \?ConstIntView?, \?MinusView?, and \?OffsetView?.
  They are all defined within the namespace \?MPG::Int?.
\item Branchings: how variables and values are selected is
  implemented by functions such as \?INT_VAR_NONE()? or
  \?INT_VAL_MIN()? and the actual branching is implemented by a
  single \?branch()? function. The good news is that no actual
  brancher must in fact be implemented, even though a number of
  rather straightforward support definitions must be
  implemented (which are contained in the namespace \?MPG::Int?).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Inline functions as simplification.}

All functions, be they member or non-member functions are defined
as \?inline?. The reason for this is to make it easier to follow
the example, as only the single header file
\DOWNLOAD{int.hh}{\texttt{int.hh}} is needed. In a real
implementation one would move the definitions of some functions to
a source file and only leave the declaration of the functions in
the header file. This is in particular true for many of the functions
defined in \autoref{chap:v:branch}.


\chapter{Variable implementations}
\label{chap:v:varimp}

This chapter describes how variable implementations can be
programmed with Gecode. The chapter uses integer interval variables
as introduced in \autoref{chap:v:started} as its running example.

\paragraph{Overview.}

The design of integer interval variables is detailed in
\autoref{sec:v:varimp:design}. After having finalized the design,
\autoref{sec:v:varimp:spec} explains how the domain-independent
base class for the variable implementation together with
definitions of modification events and propagation conditions
can be generated from a simple specification.
\autoref{sec:v:varimp:varimp} shows how the actual variable
implementation is programmed from the generated base class for a
variable implementation.  \autoref{sec:v:varimp:add} provides an
overview of additional options for generating a variable
implementation base class from its specification.


\section{Design decisions}
\label{sec:v:varimp:design}

Before starting with the description of the implementation of
integer interval variables, let us detail their design. This
includes the design of the variable domain including access and
modification operations, deltas for advisors (see
\autoref{chap:p:advisors}), modification events, and propagation
conditions.

\paragraph{Variable domain and operations.}

Unsurprisingly, the variable domain of an integer variable
implementation is represented by two integers \?l? (lower bound)
and \?u? (upper bound). The variable implementation provides
access operations \?min()? and \?max()? that return these
integers.

To modify an integer interval variable implementation, the
operation \?gq(home,n)? modifies the domain such that its values
must be greater or equal to~\?n?, whereas the operation \?lq(home,n)?
modifies the domain such that its values must be less or equal
to~\?n?.

The values \?l? and \?u? can only be initialized (when creating a
new variable, see \autoref{sec:v:var:var}) and modified such that
they obey the following invariants:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The domain is never empty, that is,
  $\mathtt{l}\leq\mathtt{u}$.
\item The domain values never exceed the limits defined by
  (\?INT_MAX? is the largest possible value for an \?int?):
  \insertsmalllitcode{int.hh:limits} 
  That is,
  $\mathtt{Int::Limits::min}\leq \mathtt l\leq \mathtt u\leq\mathtt{Int::Limits::max}$.
\end{enumerate}

The choice of values for \?Limits::min? and \?Limits::max?  are
motivated by simplicity only. To keep the example propagators
used in \autoref{chap:v:all} simple, the limits are chosen such
that the addition and subtraction of two integer values within
the limits do not lead to numerical overflow.  A real-life
variable implementation would try to make as many values as
possible available for a variable domain, see for example
\autoref{sec:m:integer:limits}.

\tip{Correctness matters}{ While the decision to restrict the
  possible values of a variable implementation is motivated by
  simplicity, the decision for a real-life variable
  implementation is absolutely essential.
  
  Being unclear about which values can correctly be maintained by
  a variable implementation, not ensuring that no numerical
  overflow occurs, or not checking for the necessary invariants
  when a new variable is created, renders the very idea of
  constraint programming obsolete: that whenever a solution is
  found by Gecode, it \emph{actually happens to be a solution}.
  Hence correctness does not only matter for implementing
  propagators and branchers but also for getting the basic design
  of variables right.  
}

\paragraph{Assigned variables.}

An integer interval variable is assigned iff $\mathtt l=\mathtt
u$.

\paragraph{Deltas for advisors.}

We design the delta information for an advisor computed by a
modification operation on the variable implementation to be an
interval as well. The interval defines the values that are
removed by a modification operation. Due to the nature of the
modification operations \?lq()? and \?gq()?, the removed values
always form an interval.

The design of deltas to be used by advisors for a variable
implementation depends directly on the design of the modification
operations provided by a variable implementation. For example, if
our integer interval variable implementation also featured an
operation \?eq()? to assign a variable implementation to a value,
then one also would have to choose a different design for the
delta information. Assume a variable implementation with domain
$\range{\mathtt{l}}{\mathtt{u}}$ and that the modification
operation \?eq(home,n)? is executed where $\mathtt{l}<\mathtt
n<\mathtt u$. Then one could design the delta information to
either accurately represent the set of removed values
$\range{\mathtt{l}}{\mathtt{n-1}}\cup\range{\mathtt{n+1}}{\mathtt{u}}$
or to provide support for signaling that the domain has changed
arbitrarily (this is the design chosen for integer variables in
Gecode, see \autoref{par:p:advisors:delta}).

\paragraph{Modification events.}

Any variable implementation must support the mandatory events for
no modification (to be implemented as \?ME_INT_NONE?), for
failure (to be implemented as \?ME_INT_FAILED?), and for
assignment to a value (to be implemented as \?ME_INT_VAL?).

The additional events must be chosen such that they take the
following two aspects into account:
\begin{itemize}
\item The modification operations should return meaningful
  values that describe how the domain of a variable
  implementation has changed. They must return \?ME_INT_VAL? if
  the variable implementation becomes assigned. Otherwise, we choose
  to return \?ME_INT_MIN? if the lower bound changes
  and to return \?ME_INT_MAX? if the upper bound changes. 
\item When a new propagator is posted and the propagator subscribes to some
  views (and hence to some variable implementations), the
  propagator must be scheduled with respect to some
  modification event. This modification event should capture that
  ``somehow the variable has changed for the propagator''. In
  case an integer interval variable implementation is not yet
  assigned (otherwise the propagator will be scheduled with the
  modification event \?ME_INT_VAL? anyway), we use an additional
  modification event \?ME_INT_BND? capturing that one or both of
  the bounds have changed.
\end{itemize}

Again, there is quite some degree of freedom in the choice of
modification events. Another design would be to only provide the
modification event \?ME_INT_BND? instead (apart from the mandatory
modification events).  An important aspect in which design to
choose is the relation between modification events and
propagation conditions to be discussed below.

\paragraph{Propagation conditions.}
\label{par:v:varimp:design:pc}

To make our example variable implementations sufficiently
interesting, we design the propagation conditions such that they
can take full advantage of the modification events.

That is, apart from the mandatory propagation condition for not
creating any subscription (to be implemented as \?PC_INT_NONE?) and the
mandatory propagation condition for an assigned variable
implementation (to be implemented as \?PC_INT_VAL?), we have
three propagation conditions as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \?PC_INT_MIN?: schedule a propagator if the lower bound of
  a variable implementation changes.
\item \?PC_INT_MAX?: schedule a propagator if the upper bound
  changes.
\item \?PC_INT_BND?: schedule a propagator if lower or upper
  bound changes.
\end{itemize}
This design can also be reformulated in terms of modification events
that are generated by a modification operation:
\begin{itemize}
\item \?PC_INT_MIN?: schedule a propagator for \?ME_INT_VAL?,
  \?ME_INT_MIN?, and \?ME_INT_BND?.
\item \?PC_INT_MAX?: schedule a propagator for \?ME_INT_VAL?,
  \?ME_INT_MAX?, and \?ME_INT_BND?.
\item \?PC_INT_BND?: schedule a propagator for \?ME_INT_VAL?,
  \?ME_INT_MIN?, \?ME_INT_MAX?, and \?ME_INT_BND?.
\end{itemize}

A simpler design would be to have the single non-mandatory propagation
condition \?PC_INT_BND?. The decision which design is best is not
straightforward, as the tradeoff between the cost for additional
propagation conditions (see below) and the gain from avoiding
propagator executions depends on many different aspects. For a
discussion and an evaluation in the context of Gecode's integer
variables, see~\cite[Section~5]{SchulteStuckey:TOPLAS:2008}.

\paragraph{Costs and limits for modification events and
  propagation conditions.}
\label{par:v:varimp:design:cost}

The cost per each individual modification event and propagation
condition is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Assume that a variable implementation uses $n$ different
  modification events (including the mandatory ones). The size of
  $n$ does not affect efficiency. To represent these modification
  events, the Gecode kernel reserves $\lceil\log_2 (n-1)\rceil$
  bits in each propagator for maintaining modification event
  deltas, see \autoref{sec:p:domain:med}. 
  
  The totally available number of bits for all variable
  implementation types used by Gecode is~$32$ (independent of
  whether Gecode is run on a $32$~bit or $64$~bit platform). That
  is, if we assume less than ten modification events per variable
  implementation type, the Gecode kernel can support at least ten
  different variable implementation types.\footnote{If you ever
    exceed this limit, please let us know.  Adding more bits is
    easy, even though we do not expect that to happen anytime
    soon.}
  
\item The number of different propagation conditions $m$ per
  variable implementation type is only limited by the largest
  value of an unsigned integer in \CPP. 
  
  For each propagation condition, every variable implementation
  needs a $32$-bit word, that is a variable implementation
  requires at least $O(m)$ space (which is typically dwarfed by
  the space consumed for actually storing the subscriptions of a
  propagator or an advisor to a variable implementation).
  
  Subscribing to a variable implementation requires $O(m)$ time.
  Canceling a subscription with propagation condition $p$
  requires $O(m+k)$ time, where $k$ is the number of
  subscriptions with propagation condition $p$.
\end{itemize}


\section{Base definitions}
\label{sec:v:varimp:spec}

The variable implementation base class together with definitions
of modification events and propagation conditions are not
programmed but are generated from a simple specification file.
The specification contains three sections: a general
section for naming, a section for modification events, and a
section for propagation conditions. 

In the following we describe how to turn the parts of the design
from the previous section that is concerned with modification
events and propagation conditions into the specification. The
member functions of the generated base class are used and
explained in the next section.

\paragraph{General section.}

\begin{figure}
\litcmdblock{
\noindent\litfile{variable implementation specification}{variable implementation specification}{int.vis}\\
\lits\lits{}\litkw{[General]}\\
\lits\lits{}Name:\lits\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}Int\\

\lits\lits{}\litkw{[End]}
}
\caption{Variable implementation specification}
\label{fig:v:varimp:vis}
\end{figure}

The specification file (named \texttt{int.vis}, where \?vis?
stands for \?v?ariable \?i?mplementation \?s?pecification;
however the file extension does not matter) is
shown in \autoref{fig:v:varimp:vis}. The specification file must
start with \litkw{[General]} defining the start of the general
section and must end with a line \litkw{[End]}. The \?Name? option defines the names of the entities to
be generated. In our example, a variable implementation base
class \?IntVarImpBase? (that is, the specified name is prepended
to \?VarImpBase?) generated, the identifiers for
modification events start with \?ME_INT_? (that is, the specified
name is put after the \?ME_? in capital letters), and the
identifiers for propagation conditions start with \?PC_INT_?. All
these definitions are contained within the namespace as defined
by the \?Namespace? option.

The general section (and also the other sections discussed below)
supports additional specification options, see
\autoref{sec:v:varimp:add} for a summary and a specification file
template for download.

\paragraph{Modification event section.}

\begin{figure}

\caption{Modification event section}
\label{fig:v:varimp:vis:me}
\end{figure}

Every modification event requires a definition that is
preceded by a line containing \litkwt{[ModEvent]} as shown in
\autoref{fig:v:varimp:vis:me}. The option \?Name? defines the
name of the modification event (in fact, just the part after
\?ME_INT_? for our example). The values on the right-hand
side of \?=? specify that some modification events are special:
\begin{itemize}
\item The modification events named \?FAILED? (that is,
  \?ME_INT_FAILED?) and \?NONE? (that is, \?ME_INT_NONE?)
  are defined to be the events for failure (\?=FAILED?) and no
  change (\?=NONE?).
\item The modification event named \?VAL? is defined to be the
  event when a variable implementation becomes assigned
  (\?=ASSIGNED?) to a
  value.
\item The modification event named \?BND? is defined to be used
  for scheduling a propagator when the propagator subscribes to a
  non-assigned variable implementation (\?=SUBSCRIBE?).
\end{itemize}

Any variable implementation must define special events with
\?=NONE?, \?=FAILED?, and \?=ASSIGNED?.

The section for modification events also defines how
modification events are combined with a \?Combine?
option. The combination of modification events is needed for the
correctness of scheduling propagators and also for
modification event deltas, see \autoref{sec:p:domain:med}.  An
entry $l=r$ for the modification event $m$ defines that $m$
combined with $l$ is $r$. 

The definition of the combination of modification events can be
expressed as a table:
\begin{center}\ttfamily
\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|}
   &VAL&MIN&MAX&BND\\\hline\hline
VAL&VAL&VAL&VAL&VAL\\\hline
MIN&VAL&MIN&BND&BND\\\hline
MAX&VAL&BND&MAX&BND\\\hline
BND&VAL&BND&BND&BND\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This table is exactly what is specified by the \?Combine?
options. The special modification events \?NONE? and
\?FAILED? do not have a \?Combine? option.

We will not present the full mathematical detail of the
properties that must hold for the combination of modification
events, the theory is presented
in~\cite[Section~5.5]{Tack:PhD:2009}.

\paragraph{Propagation condition section.}

\begin{figure}
\litcmdblock{%
\noindent\litlabel{lit:vis:propcond}{propagation conditions}\\
\lits\lits{}\litkw{[PropCond]}\\
\lits\lits{}Name:\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}NONE=NONE\\

\lits\lits{}ScheduledBy:\lits{}VAL,\lits{}BND,\lits{}MAX}
\caption{Propagation condition section}
\label{fig:v:varimp:vis:pc}
\end{figure}

Every propagation condition requires a definition that is
preceded by a line containing \litkwt{[PropCond]} as shown in
\autoref{fig:v:varimp:vis:pc}. The option \?Name? defines the
name of the propagation condition (in fact, just the part after
\?PC_INT_? for our example). The values on the right-hand
side of \?=? specify that some propagation conditions are special:
\begin{itemize}
\item The propagation condition named \?NONE? (that is, \?PC_INT_NONE?)
  is defined to be the propagation condition for not creating any
  subscription (\?=NONE?).
\item The propagation condition named \?VAL? (that is,
  \?PC_INT_VAL?) is defined to be the condition when a propagator
  wants to subscribe to the event that a variable implementation
  becomes assigned (\?=ASSIGNED?).
\end{itemize}

Any variable implementation must define the special propagation conditions 
\?=NONE? and \?=ASSIGNED?.

For each propagation condition (but for \?=NONE?), it must be
defined by a \?ScheduledBy? option which modification events
schedule a propagator for execution. That is, when defining a
propagation condition $p$, an entry $m$ in the list of
modification events defines the following: a propagator
subscribed to a variable implementation $x$ with propagation
condition $p$ is scheduled for execution when a modification
operation on $x$ returns the modification event $m$.  The
modification events in our example correspond to the design
presented in \autoref{par:v:varimp:design:pc}.


\section{Variable implementation}
\label{sec:v:varimp:varimp}


\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:variable implementation}
\caption{Variable implementation}
\label{fig:v:varimp:varimp}
\end{figure}

The variable implementation for integer interval variables is
shown in \autoref{fig:v:varimp:varimp}. As discussed in the
previous sections, the variable implementation inherits from the
generated base class \?IntVarImpBase? and implements a lower
bound \?l? and an upper bound \?u?.

\paragraph{Access operations.}

Every variable implementation must implement a member function
\?assigned()? that tests whether the variable is assigned to a
value:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:varimp:assignment test}

The test for assignment is used in the implementation of other member
functions of the variable implementation. Furthermore, variables
and views automatically provide implementations of a member
function \?assigned()? that calls the \?assigned()?
function of their variable implementation.

\begin{samepage}
The access operations for the lower and upper bound are
straightforward. Here, and in the following, we only show
one of the operations, the operation for the other bound is
analogous:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:varimp:access operations}
\end{samepage}

\paragraph{Modification operations.}

The modification operations must notify the Gecode kernel if a
variable implementation is modified. As a description how a
variable implementation changes, they must
pass a modification event and
delta information for advisors to a member function \?notify()?.
The \?notify()? function executes subscribed advisors and
schedules subscribed propagators (depending on the passed
modification event and the propagators' propagation conditions).
The \?notify()? function is inherited from the generated variable
implementation base class and depends on the specified
modification events and propagation conditions.

The delta information is implemented as discussed in
\autoref{sec:v:varimp:design} as an interval with lower and upper
bound:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:varimp:delta for advisors}

The actual modification operations first test whether the
variable implementation does not require modification or whether
the operation fails and only then perform the actual modification.
Before updating the upper bound \?u? to \?n?, the
\?lq()?  operation creates the delta information \?d? that describes
that values between \?n+1? and \?u? are being removed. 

The \?notify()?  function is given the \?home? space, a
modification event, and the variable delta \?d? as argument. The
modification event passed to \?notify()? must capture how the
domain has changed.  In particular, it must reflect whether the
variable implementation has been assigned. The \?notify()?
function executes the advisors subscribed to this variable
implementation and schedules all subscribed propagators with
appropriate propagation conditions. Note that the \?notify()?
function returns a modification event. In case an advisor reports
failure after its execution, \?notify()? returns \?ME_INT_FAILED?. Otherwise it
returns the modification event that has been passed as argument:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:varimp:modification operations}

\tip{Variable implementations must always be consistent}{
Even if a modification operation fails, the data structures for
the variable implementation must be still consistent. That is,
all operations must still work. See also
\autoref{sec:m:integer:empty}.
}

\paragraph{Delta information access.}

The variable implementation must also implement functions that
provide access to the delta information:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:varimp:delta information}

This construction appears nonsensical at first sight, however
there are two good reasons why a variable implementation
interprets the information stored in the delta information (of
course, in that case one would have to declare the operation as
\?const? but not \?static?).  First, the variable implementation
can change the information based on its own state. Second, the
very same idea is needed for views (see
\autoref{sec:v:view:offset} for an example) and hence this design
keeps the interfaces of views and variable implementations as
similar as possible.

\paragraph{Subscriptions.}

A variable implementation must implement \?subscribe()? and
\?cancel()? operations for both propagators and advisors. The
implementation of these operations always follow the
same structure as shown below. 

The reason why these functions have to be implemented in the variable
implementation class even though they are (in slightly different
form) already defined in the variable implementation base class
is that they require information about whether
a variable implementation is assigned. The
definitions are as follows:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:varimp:subscriptions}

\paragraph{Copying during cloning.}

Copying a variable implementation during cloning is implemented
by a constructor and a \?copy()? function. The constructor is
straightforward and the \?copy()? function only creates a new
variable implementation if the variable implementation has not been copied before. If it
has been copied before (that is, \?copied()?  returns \?true?),
the \?copy()? function must return the forwarding pointer to the
previously created copy as follows:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:varimp:copying}

\paragraph{Additional inherited member functions.}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{access operations}}\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Summary of member functions predefined by variable implementations}
\label{fig:v:varimp:inherited}
\end{figure}

In addition to the constructor and the member functions defined
and used by our variable implementation, several other member
functions are typically just inherited and are defined by the
class \gecoderef[class]{VarImp}. The most important inherited
member functions are summarized in
\autoref{fig:v:varimp:inherited}.  For an explanation of degree
and accumulated failure count, see
\autoref{sec:m:branch:shared}.


\section{Additional specification options}
\label{sec:v:varimp:add}

This section provides an overview of additional specification
options not discussed in \autoref{sec:v:varimp:spec}.

\paragraph{Comments.}

Any line starting with \?#? is discarded and hence can serve as a
comment in the specification file.

\paragraph{Generating headers, footers, and comments.}

Any text after the options for a \litkwt{[ModEvent]} and
\litkwt{[PropCond]} definition until the next definition is added
to the generated \CPP-code before the generated identifier
definition. This can be used for defining comments to be added to
the generated \CPP-code. For example, by
\litcmdblock{%
\lits\lits{}\litkw{[PropCond]}\\
\lits\lits{}Name:\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}\lits{}NONE=NONE\\
\lits\lits{}// Propagation condition to be ignored\\
\lits\lits{}\litkw{[PropCond]}\\
\lits\lits{}\litanon}
the comment
\begin{code}
// Propagation condition to be ignored
\end{code}
is put before the definition of the generated
propagation condition.

Related support exists for putting a header before (or a footer
after) all generated definitions for modification events and
propagation conditions: The text following
\litkwt{[ModEventHeader]}, \litkwt{[ModEventFooter]},
\litkwt{[PropCondHeader]}, and \litkwt{[PropCondFooter]} is
inserted at the respective places in the generated code.

\paragraph{Conditional compilation.}

Giving an option \texttt{Ifdef} in the general section
followed by some \CPP-preprocessor identifier \?IDENT? wraps the
entire generated code in preprocessor directives as follows:
\begin{code}
#ifdef IDENT
  ...
#endif
\end{code}
By this, the Gecode kernel can be compiled with or without a
particular variable type without being forced to reconfigure the
Gecode kernel, see also \autoref{sec:v:all:conf}.

\paragraph{Explicitly disposing variable implementations.}
\label{par:v:varimp:dispose}

Our example variables are entirely space-allocated and do not
require external memory or other resources. However, for some
variable types, the variable implementation might use external
resources or memory that is not space-allocated and must
explicitly be freed. 

For an example, suppose the integer interval variables had been
implemented by using arbitrary precision integers for the lower
and upper bound and that these bounds must explicitly be freed.

By specifying in the general section
\litcmdblock{%
\lits\lits{}Dispose:\lits{}true
}
and implementing in the variable implementation class a 
\?dispose(Space& home)? member function, all variable
implementations are disposed by calling their \?dispose()?
functions. The variable implementations are disposed when their
home space is deleted.

Additionally, an object must be created that controls the
disposal of variable implementations. Assume that our example
integer variables used external memory and that its specification
file contains
\litcmdblock{%
\lits\lits{}Dispose:\lits{}true
}
and that \?MPG::IntVarImp? implements a \?dispose()? function.
Then, your program must
create a variable implementation disposer as follows:
\begin{code}
Gecode::VarImpDisposer<MPG::IntVarImp> disposer;
\end{code}
The \?disposer? object must be initialized before the first
variable using \?MPG::IntVarImp? is created.

\paragraph{Reserving bits.}

A limited number of bits $b$ can be reserved within each variable
implementation by specifying in the general section
\litcmdblock{%
\lits\lits{}Bits:\lits{}$b$
}
Then, the variable implementation can get a reference to a value
of type \?unsigned int? by calling the member function \?bits()?
where the least $b$ bits can be used freely. However, the maximal
number of subscriptions (both propagators and advisors) for that
variable implementation type is reduced from $2^{31}-1$ to
$2^{31-b}-1$. Furthermore, any attempt to use more than the
specified number of bits will crash Gecode in a truly
spectacular fashion!

\paragraph{Specification file template.}

The \DOWNLOAD{template.vis}{specification template} contains all
possible specification options to assist in defining your own
variable types.


\chapter[Variables and variable arrays]{Variables and\\variable arrays}
\label{chap:v:var}

This chapter describes how variables can be programmed from
variable implementations and how variable arrays and variable argument
arrays can be programmed. The chapter uses integer interval
variables as introduced in \autoref{chap:v:started} together with
their implementations as defined in \autoref{chap:v:varimp} as
its running example.

\paragraph{Overview.}

How integer interval variables are implemented is detailed in
\autoref{sec:v:var:var}. Variable arrays and variable argument
arrays are discussed in \autoref{sec:v:var:array}.


\section{Variables}
\label{sec:v:var:var}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:var:variable}
\caption{Variable programmed from a variable implementation}
\label{fig:v:var:var}
\end{figure}

As a variable is just a read-only interface to a variable
implementation, its implementation is straightforward.
The definition of integer variables is shown in
\autoref{fig:v:var:var}. The copy constructor uses the
member function \?varimp()? that returns the pointer to the
variable's variable implementation. Note that every variable must
have a constructor that takes a pointer to the corresponding
variable implementation as argument.

Note that within the class \?IntVar?, a pointer to the
corresponding variable implementation is available as protected
member \?x?  (see \autoref{tip:p:views:using} for information on
\?using?).

One also must define an output operator \?<<? for a variable as
shown in \autoref{fig:v:var:var}.

It is important to remember that variables are defined in the
namespace \?MPG?. This is in contrast to
variable implementations, which are defined in the namespace
\?MPG::Int?. 

\paragraph{Variable creation.}

Creating a new variable is done with the following constructor
that creates a new variable implementation as follows:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:var:variable creation}

Note that the constructor ensures the invariants for the lower
and upper bound of a variable as discussed in
\autoref{sec:v:varimp:design} by possibly throwing exceptions.

\paragraph{Access operations.}

In addition to constructors, variables typically implement the
same access operations as their corresponding variable
implementation:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:var:access operations}


\paragraph{Additional inherited member functions.}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{access operations}}\\
\?varimp()? & returns pointer to variable implementation\\
\?assigned()? & whether variable is assigned\\
\?degree()? & returns degree (number of subscriptions)\\
\?afc()? & returns accumulated failure count\\
\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{update during cloning}}\\
\?update()? & updates variable during cloning\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Summary of member functions predefined by variables}
\label{fig:v:var:inherited}
\end{figure}

In addition to the constructor and member functions defined by
our variables, several other member functions are typically just
inherited and are defined by the class \gecoderef[class]{VarImpVar}.
The most important inherited member functions are summarized in
\autoref{fig:v:var:inherited}.  For an explanation of degree and
accumulated failure count, see \autoref{sec:m:branch:shared}.



\section{Variable arrays and variable argument arrays}
\label{sec:v:var:array}

Defining variable arrays and variable argument arrays (see also
\autoref{sec:m:integer:proper}) requires the implementation of
the arrays proper together with some traits. The traits classes
for variable arrays and variable argument arrays ensure that
Gecode-provided functionality for arrays can be used with the
newly defined arrays.

\paragraph{Array traits.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:array traits}
\caption{Array traits for variable arrays}
\label{fig:v:var:traits}
\end{figure}

The definition of the array traits classes is shown in
\autoref{fig:v:var:traits}. The definition is done in two
steps. The first step provides forward declarations of the array
types \?IntVarArgs? and \?IntVarArray? in the namespace \?MPG?
(because that is where these arrays will be defined). 

The second step requires to define traits for these two array
types. The trait classes must be defined in the namespace
\?Gecode?. For each array type, two traits classes are needed:
one for the base class (for example, \?Gecode::VarArray<MPG::IntVar>?)
and one for the class to be implemented (for example,
\?MPG::IntVarArray?). The definitions for the array type and its
base class must be identical and follow the examples shown in
\autoref{fig:v:var:traits}.

\paragraph{Variable arrays.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:variable arrays}
\caption{Variable arrays}
\label{fig:v:var:array}
\end{figure}

The implementation of variable arrays and variable argument
arrays typically only require the implementation of various
constructors when inheriting from the base classes
\gecoderef[class]{VarArray} and \gecoderef[class]{VarArgArray}.
The minimal set of constructors such that the arrays are
compatible to arrays as used by Gecode is shown in
\autoref{fig:v:var:array}.




\chapter{Views}
\label{chap:v:view}

This chapter describes how views as needed for programming
propagators and branchers can be programmed. The chapter uses
integer interval variables as introduced in
\autoref{chap:v:started} together with their implementations as
defined in \autoref{chap:v:varimp} as its running example.

\paragraph{Overview.}

\mbox{}\autoref{sec:v:view:types} provides an overview of the
different types of views available in Gecode. The remaining
sections provide examples for each different view type:
\autoref{sec:v:view:varview} shows how an integer view \?IntView?
is constructed as a variable implementation view;
\autoref{sec:v:view:const} shows how a constant integer view
\?ConstIntView? is programmed as a constant view;
\autoref{sec:v:view:derived} shows how a minus view \?MinusView?
and an offset view \?OffsetView? are programmed as derived views.


\section{View types}
\label{sec:v:view:types}

Gecode provides three different types of views:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Variable implementation views}: a variable
  implementation view is nothing but a direct interface to a
  variable implementation. A variable implementation view must
  inherit from \gecoderef[class]{VarImpView}. The class
  \gecoderef[class]{VarImpView} is parametric with respect to a
  variable and \emph{not a variable implementation} (as one might
  expect). This is due to the fact that the type of the variable
  implementation can be obtained automatically from the type of a
  variable. Making a variable implementation view parametric with
  respect to a variable type has the advantage that information
  on both the variable type and variable implementation type
  become available.
\item \emph{Constant views}: a constant view must implement the
  same interface and must perform the same operations as some
  assigned variable implementation view. This particular variable
  implementation view is called the \emph{corresponding} variable
  implementation view.  A constant view must inherit from
  \gecoderef[class]{ConstView} which is parametric with respect
  to the corresponding variable implementation view.
\item \emph{Derived views}: a derived view is a view that is
  implemented in terms of some other view (all view types are
  possible: variable implementation, constant, and derived). The
  view from which the derived view is derived, is called
  the \emph{base} view. A
  derived view must inherit from \gecoderef[class]{DerivedView}
  which is parametric with respect to the base view.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Predefined member functions.}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{access operations}}\\
\?varimp()? & returns pointer to variable implementation\\
\?assigned()? & whether variable is assigned\\

\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{update during cloning}}\\
\?update()? & updates view during cloning\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Summary of member functions predefined by views}
\label{fig:v:view:predefined}
\end{figure}

The classes \gecoderef[class]{VarImpView},
\gecoderef[class]{ConstView}, and \gecoderef[class]{DerivedView}
define already many member functions that simplify the
implementation of new views. The most important predefined member
functions are summarized in \autoref{fig:v:view:predefined}.

Note that the \?varimp()? function for a constant view or for a
view derived from a constant view returns \?NULL?, as no variable
implementation exists.

\paragraph{View test functions.}

There are three different functions predefined for views:
\begin{itemize}
\item The function \?shared(x,y)? returns \?true?, if both views
  \?x? and \?y? share a common variable implementation (see
  \autoref{par:p:views:sameshared}). Typically, the definition
  of \?shared()? does not need to be overloaded for newly defined views.
\item The function \?same(x,y)? returns \?true?, if both views
  \?x? and \?y? are identical (see
  \autoref{par:p:views:sameshared}). In some cases, the definition
  of \?same()? must be overloaded for newly defined views (see
  \autoref{sec:v:view:const} and \autoref{sec:v:view:offset} for
  examples). 
\item The function \?before(x,y)? returns \?true?, if \?x? comes
  before \?y? in some arbitrary total and strict order for
  ordering views. The function is mainly used for sorting arrays
  of views into some order (in particular for detecting
  duplicate views).  In some cases, the definition
  of \?before()? must be overloaded for newly defined views (see
  \autoref{sec:v:view:const} and \autoref{sec:v:view:offset} for
  examples). 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Output operator.}

For every view also an output operator \?<<? must be defined. We
sketch this only for integer views in
\autoref{sec:v:view:varview}, for all other views the definition
is analogous.

\section{Variable implementation views: integer view}
\label{sec:v:view:varview}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:integer view}
\caption{Integer view}
\label{fig:v:view:int}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:v:view:int} shows the definition of the class
\?IntView? for integer views from the class
\gecoderef[class]{VarImpView} for variable implementation
views. Please remember that a variable implementation view is
parametric with respect to a variable type (\?IntVar? in our
example, such that \?IntView? uses the same variable
implementation type \?IntVarImp? as \?IntVar? does).

Similar to variables obtained from variable implementations, a
variable implementation view has a protected member \?x? that is
a pointer to its variable implementation (see
\autoref{tip:p:views:using} for information on \?using?).  A
variable implementation view must implement at least the shown
constructors such that it can be initialized both from the
corresponding variable type and from the corresponding variable
implementation type.

The remaining implementation tasks for variable implementation
views are straightforward: all operations that are specific to a
variable type (in our case, specific to integer interval
variables) must be implemented. The implementation is 
straightforward as only the corresponding operations of the
variable implementation are invoked:
\begin{itemize}
\item The access operations must be implemented:
\insertsmalllitcode{int.hh:intview:access operations}
\item 
\begin{samepage}
The modification operations must be implemented:
\insertsmalllitcode{int.hh:intview:modification operations}
\end{samepage}
\item Finally, the operations for accessing delta information must
be implemented:
\insertsmalllitcode{int.hh:intview:delta information}
\end{itemize}

\section{Constant views: constant integer view}
\label{sec:v:view:const}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:constant integer view}
\caption{Constant integer view}
\label{fig:v:view:const}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:v:view:const} shows the implementation of a constant
integer view with \?IntView? as the corresponding variable
implementation view. A constant integer view \?ConstIntView?
stores an integer value \?x? and must implement all
variable-specific operations that are implemented by the
corresponding \?IntView? class (as shown in
\autoref{fig:v:view:const}).

Slightly less obvious is the implementation of operations that
access delta information. While these operations must be implemented such that
constant integer views can be used instead of integer views, they
will never be executed (by definition, a constant view can
never change). Hence we use the macro
\?GECODE_NEVER? (see \autoref{tip:b:started:never}) to clarify
that the delta information operations are never executed:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:constintview:delta information}

\paragraph{Update during cloning.}

The definition of the \?update()? member function of
\gecoderef[class]{ConstView} does not take care of the integer
value \?x?. Hence we need to provide a new \?update()? function
that updates the value of \?x? as follows:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:constintview:update during cloning}

\paragraph{View tests.}

Also the default definitions of the view test functions \?same()?
and \?before()? for constant views do not take the integer value \?x?
of the view into account. Overloaded versions for
constant integer views are as follows:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:constintview:view tests}


\section{Derived views}
\label{sec:v:view:derived}

This section exemplifies two different derived views: minus views
and offset views. Why these views are useful and what their
semantics is can be seen in \autoref{sec:p:views:int:minus} for
minus views and in \autoref{sec:p:views:int:offset} for offset
views.

\subsection{Minus views}
\label{sec:v:view:minus}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:minus view}
\caption{Minus view}
\label{fig:v:view:minus}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:v:view:minus} shows that a minus view is derived
from an integer view \?IntView?. The protected member \?x?
refers to the base view, that is the integer view from which the
minus view is derived (see \autoref{tip:p:views:using} for
information on \?using?).

\begin{samepage}
\paragraph{Access operations.}

The access operations are as to be expected for a minus view.
That is, the lower bound of the derived view is the negation of
the upper bound of the base view:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:minusview:access operations}
\end{samepage}

\paragraph{Modification operations.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:minusview:modification events and propagation conditions}
\caption{Negation of modification events and propagation conditions}
\label{fig:v:view:minusmepc}
\end{figure}

The modification operations are slightly more involved than the
access operations as they return a modification event. If the
modification event of the base view is \?ME_INT_MAX? (the upper
bound of the base view has changed), then the modification event
for the derived view must be \?ME_INT_MIN? (the lower bound of
the derived view has changed).

\autoref{fig:v:view:minusmepc} shows functions \?minusme()? and
\?minuspc()? that return the negation of modification events and
propagation conditions (to be discussed later).

\begin{samepage}
Using the function \?minusme?, the modification operations can be
defined as follows:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:minusview:modification operations}
\end{samepage}

\paragraph{Accessing delta information.}

Accessing delta information must also take into account that the
modification event stored in a delta must be converted with
\?minusme()?. Also the other operations for
accessing delta information must be adopted accordingly:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:minusview:delta information}

\paragraph{Additional operations.}

Any operation that is concerned with either modification events
or propagation conditions must be implemented to take the switch
between lower bound and upper bound into account. These operations
include the operations for handling subscriptions of propagators
(the function \?minuspc()? is defined analogously to
\?minusme()? in \autoref{fig:v:view:minusmepc}):
\insertlitcode{int.hh:minusview:subscriptions}

Note that the operations that subscribe and cancel advisors must
be re-implemented even though they are unchanged. This is due to
inheritance in \CPP: as the overloaded functions for propagators
are redefined, also the functions for advisors are considered to
be redefined.

\begin{samepage}
The remaining operations to be implemented are support operations:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:minusview:support operations}
\end{samepage}



\subsection{Offset views}
\label{sec:v:view:offset}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:offset view}
\caption{Offset view}
\label{fig:v:view:offset}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:v:view:offset} shows that an offset view is derived
from an integer view \?IntView? and stores an additional integer
value \?c? for the offset. The protected member \?x?
refers to the base view, that is the integer view from which the
offset view is derived (see \autoref{tip:p:views:using} for
information on \?using?). The access, modification, and delta
information access operations of an offset view are as
to be expected.

The \?update()? function must also update the integer offset \?c?
as follows:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:offsetview:update during cloning}

Likewise, the view test functions \?same()? and \?before()? must
take into account the integer offset \?c?:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:offsetview:view tests}


\chapter{Variable-value branchings}
\label{chap:v:branch}

This chapter explains how to program common variable-value
branchings using the abstractions provided by Gecode.

\paragraph{Overview.}

\mbox{}\autoref{sec:v:branch:type} explains which simple types
must be defined for variable-value branchings. How functions for
variable selection and value selection are implemented is
demonstrated in \autoref{sec:v:branch:varval}.
\autoref{sec:v:branch:viewsel} shows how a function that creates
an object for selecting views during branching is implemented.
How functions for selecting values and committing to these values
are implemented is shown in \autoref{sec:v:branch:valcommit}. How
the actual branchings are implemented is then detailed in
\autoref{sec:v:branch:branch}.

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:branching}
\caption{Part of header file concerned with branching}
\label{fig:v:branch:structure}
\end{figure}

This structure is reflected in the part of the
\DOWNLOAD{int.hh}{\texttt{int.hh}} header file that is concerned
with branching (shown in \autoref{fig:v:branch:structure}).


\section{Type, traits, and activity definitions}
\label{sec:v:branch:type}

The way how a variable-value branching works can to some
extent be controlled by the user by passing pointers to functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item A branching filter function defines which variables are
  actually considered for branching, see
  \autoref{sec:m:branch:filter}.
\item A merit function can define which variable is selected for
  branching, see \autoref{sec:m:branch:uservar}.
\item A branch value function selects a value that is used for
  branching, see \autoref{sec:m:branch:userval}.
\item A branch commit function constrains a variable with respect
  to a value passed as argument, see
  \autoref{sec:m:branch:userval}.
\end{itemize}

In the following type definitions, the type \?IntVar? of the
argument \?x?, the return type \?int? of the branch value
function of type \?IntBranchVal?, and the type \?int? of the
argument \?n? is dependent on our integer interval variables
(they are of type \?IntVar? and they take values of type \?int?).

\begin{samepage}
  The remaining argument and return types are required by Gecode and are as
  follows: 
\insertlitcode{int.hh:branch function types}
\end{samepage}

These function type definitions must be connected to the variable
type \?IntVar? by means of a traits-class of type \?BranchTraits?.
As the functionality for variable-value branching is defined in
the \?Gecode? namespace, the trait class must also be defined
there: 
\insertlitcode{int.hh:branch traits}

The last remaining definitions specializes AFC and activity information
for integer interval variables by defining a class \?IntAFC? as
follows:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:variable AFC}
and a class \?IntActivity?
as follows:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:variable activity}
The actual implementations are omitted as they contain nothing more
than the type specialization and creation of view arrays in the
initializing constructor and the \?init()? function.

\section{Variable and value selection}
\label{sec:v:branch:varval}

An important part of the interface of the branching is support
for specifying how variables and values are selected for
branching. This is implemented by a set of variable and value
selection functions that are used for specification. These
functions return objects that are then used for creating the
appropriate branchers. In this section we are not interested in
describing a complete set of variable and value selection
functions but in a set that demonstrates the features of
variable-value branchings well.

\paragraph{Variable selection.}

The variable selection functions we are considering here are
defined as follows (their names and what they do coincides with
the variable selection functions for normal integer variables in
Gecode, see \autoref{sec:m:branch:int}):
\insertlitcode{int.hh:variable selection functions}

All but \?INT_VAR_NONE()? take arguments: unsurprisingly, a
random number generator must be passed to \?INT_VAR_RND()? and a
double as decay-factor or an integer activity object to
\?INT_VAR_ACTIVITY_MAX()?. Both \?INT_VAR_NONE()? and
\?INT_VAR_RND()? are special in that they are not useful for
tie-breaking. All other variable selection functions take an
optional argument of type \?BranchTbl? as a branch tie-breaking
limit function (we will abbreviate this here as tbl-function),
see \autoref{sec:m:branch:tbl} for a description of
tie-breaking and tbl-functions.

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:variable selection class}
\caption{Variable selection class}
\label{fig:v:branch:intvarbranch}
\end{figure}

The implementation of the variable selection functions is simple:
each function returns an object of class \?IntVarBranch? that
stores all necessary information required for creating the
appropriate brancher. As an example of an implementation consider
the following, the other functions are similar:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:variable selection function implementation}

The function \?function_cast()? is defined by Gecode and can be
used to cast function pointers\footnote{Normal pointers (that is,
  pointers to data) and function pointers cannot be casted into each other
  in \CPP, that is why Gecode provides the function \?function_cast()?.}. The
type \?VoidFunction? is a generic base type for function pointers
defined by Gecode.

The implementation of the class \?IntVarBranch? is shown in
\autoref{fig:v:branch:intvarbranch}. It defines an enumeration of
all variable selection strategies and a set of constructors for
the different types of arguments the variable selection functions
take. The \?select()? function returns a value of the
enumeration type that is stored by the object. All other
information is handled by the base class
\gecoderef[class]{VarBranch}.

The class must also implement an \?expand()? member function. It
checks whether \?INT_VAR_ACTIVITY_MAX()? had been called just
with a decay-factor instead of an integer activity object. In
this case it creates an integer activity object and stores it as follows:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:expand activity}


\paragraph{Value selection.}

Value selection functions are implemented similarly to variable
selection functions. They return an object of class
\?IntValBranch? (inheriting from the base class
\gecoderef[class]{ValBranch}) which stores the necessary information for
creating the appropriate brancher. We are considering the
following value selection functions as examples:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:value selection functions}

Note that the last argument of the value selection function
\?INT_VAL()? is optional, the default behavior will be defined in
\autoref{sec:v:branch:valcommit}.


\section{View selection creation}
\label{sec:v:branch:viewsel}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:view selection creation function}
\caption{View selection creation function}
\label{fig:v:branch:viewsel}
\end{figure}

The view selection creation function shown in
\autoref{fig:v:branch:viewsel} takes an object \?ivb? of class
\?IntVarBranch? as an argument, creates an object of class
\gecoderef[class]{ViewSel} and returns a pointer to it. The
object \?ivb? is a specification of which object should be
returned. The returned object is used to select views during
brancher execution.

Selection of the first unassigned view (corresponding to
\?SEL_NONE?, that is, the object \?ivb? has been created by
calling the function \?INT_VAR_NONE()?) is
implemented by the Gecode-defined class
\gecoderef[class]{ViewSelNone}. Also random view selection is
provided by Gecode through the class
\gecoderef[class]{ViewSelRnd}. Both classes are
parametric with respect to a view type. 

\paragraph{View selection with tbl-function.}

The other strategies for view selection exist in two variants:
one variant that uses a tbl-function and one variant that does
not. In case a tbl-function has been supplied as additional
argument to one of the variable selection functions, the
following creates the appropriate object for view selection:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:view selection with tbl-function}

Depending on how the view is to be selected, different objects
are created. An object of class \gecoderef[class]{ViewSelMaxTbl}
selects a variable with maximal merit (for the definition of
merit, see \autoref{sec:m:branch:int}), whereas an object
of class \gecoderef[class]{ViewSelMinTbl} selects a variable with
minimal merit. Objects of both classes take a tbl-function during
selection into account. Both classes expect a class as template argument
that computes the actual merit value for a given view. 

The classes \gecoderef[class]{MeritFunction},
\gecoderef[class]{MeritDegree}, and
\gecoderef[class]{MeritActivity} are defined by Gecode and are
parametric with respect to the actual view type.

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:size merit class}
\caption{Size merit class}
\label{fig:v:branch:meritsize}
\end{figure}

Selecting a view with minimal size 
is specific to our integer interval variables and views. The
implementation of the class \?MeritSize? inherits from
\gecoderef[class]{MeritBase} and is shown in
\autoref{fig:v:branch:meritsize}. 

The class \gecoderef[class]{MeritBase} is parametric with respect
to the view type (\?IntView? in our case) and the type of the
merit value (\?unsigned int? in our case).
The constructors are as to be expected and the call operator must
return the merit value of type \?unsigned int? (the same as the
second template argument to \gecoderef[class]{MeritBase}) of the
view \?x? (\?i? refers to the position of the view \?x? in the array
of views used in the brancher).

In case the merit class uses members that must be deallocated
when the home-space is deleted, the merit class must redefine the
member functions \?notice()? and \?dispose()?, for example by:
\begin{code}
bool notice(void) const {
  return true;
}
void dispose(Space& home) {
  ...
}
\end{code}


\paragraph{View selection without tbl-function.}

Implementing view selection without a tbl-function is analogous,
the only difference is that the classes
\gecoderef[class]{ViewSelMax} (instead of
\gecoderef[class]{ViewSelMaxTbl}) and
\gecoderef[class]{ViewSelMin} (instead of
\gecoderef[class]{ViewSelMinTbl}) must be used:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:view selection without tbl-function}

\section{Value selection and commit creation}
\label{sec:v:branch:valcommit}


\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:value selection and commit creation function}
\caption{Value selection and commit creation function}
\label{fig:v:branch:valcommit}
\end{figure}

The value selection and commit creation function is very similar
to the variable selection creation function from the previous
section. It creates and returns an object that performs value
selection and value commit during branching depending on a
specification object of class \?IntValBranch?. 

The function is
shown in \autoref{fig:v:branch:valcommit} and returns an object
of class \gecoderef[class]{ValSelCommitBase}. Again, this class
is parametric with respect to the view type (\?IntView?) and the
value type (\?int?). Depending on which value selection strategy
is defined by the argument \?ivb?,  a corresponding object of
class \gecoderef[class]{ValSelCommit} is created.

The class \gecoderef[class]{ValSelCommit} is parametric with
respect to a value selection class and a value commit class (to be
discussed below). The classes \?ValSelMin?, \?ValSelRnd?, and
\?ValCommitLq? are specific to integer interval variables and
views and are discussed below.

\paragraph{Value selection classes.}

A value selection class must inherit from the class
\gecoderef[class]{ValSel} which again is parametric with respect
to the view and value type. The constructors (one for creation
and for cloning) are exactly the same as for merit classes
discussed in the previous section.

  Also, similar to merit
classes, a value selection class can redefine the member
functions \?notice()? and \?dispose()? if explicit disposal is
required when the home-space is deleted.

\begin{samepage}
In addition, the classes must define a member function \?val()?
that returns a value for a given view \?x? as follows (\?i? again
is the position in the view array):
\insertlitcode{int.hh:value selection classes}
\end{samepage}

\paragraph{Value commit classes.}

For our integer interval variables and views we need a single
value commit class only (how many classes are needed depends of
course on which value selection strategies are provided). A value
commit class must inherit from the parametric class
\gecoderef[class]{ValCommit} and must implement one constructor
for creation and one for cloning. In addition, it must define a
commit function that returns a modification event and takes the
number of the alternative \?a?, a view \?x?, its position \?i?,
and a value \?n? as arguments: 
\insertlitcode{int.hh:value commit classes}

    
\paragraph{User-defined value selection and commit functions.}

For the value selection function \?INT_VAL(v,c)? for a
user-defined value
selection function \?v? and a user-defined commit function \?c?
it is possible to leave out \?c?, as it has been declared as an
optional argument. When the argument is not provided, \?c? is
equal to \?NULL?. This is taken into account as follows:
\insertlitcode{int.hh:user-defined value selection and commit functions}
The classes \gecoderef[class]{ValSelFunction} and
\gecoderef[class]{ValCommitFunction} are defined by Gecode and
are parametric with respect to a view. They use the functions as
specified by the object \?ivb?.



\section{Branchings}
\label{sec:v:branch:branch}

Implementing the actual \?branch()? functions with and without
tie-breaking is straightforward. They only have to create a
brancher that uses the view selection creation function
\?viewsel()? from \autoref{sec:v:branch:viewsel} and the value
selection and commit creation function \?valselcommit()? from 
\autoref{fig:v:branch:valcommit}.

\paragraph{Branching without tie-breaking.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:branch function}
\caption{Branch function}
\label{fig:v:branch:branch}
\end{figure}

The \?branch()? function is shown
in \autoref{fig:v:branch:branch}. It creates an array of integer
views \?IntView?, expands a possibly missing integer activity
object, creates an array with a single view selector
object returned by the function \?viewsel()? as discussed in
\autoref{sec:v:branch:viewsel}, posts the view-value brancher
of class \gecoderef[class]{ViewValBrancher}, and returns a
brancher handle of class \gecoderef[class]{BrancherHandle} (see
also \autoref{sec:m:branch:basics}) to the
posted brancher. The class is
parametric, where the arguments describe the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The view type which is \?IntView? in our case.
\item The number of view selection objects to be used during view
  selection. As we are not using tie-breaking, the number is \?1?
  and corresponds to the number of elements in the array \?vs?.
\item The value type which is \?int? in our case.
\item The number of alternatives that should be created during
  branching, which is \?2? in our example\footnote{By choosing
    the value \?1? here, one can obtain branchers that perform
    value assignment similar to the \?assign()? function
    described in \autoref{sec:m:branch:assign}.}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Branching with tie-breaking.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{int.hh:branch function with tie-breaking}
\caption{Branch function with tie-breaking}
\label{fig:v:branch:branchtb}
\end{figure}

The \?branch()? function with tie-breaking is shown in
\autoref{fig:v:branch:branchtb}. It takes an object \?vars? of class
\gecoderef[class]{TieBreak} as argument, where \?vars.a? is the
first variable selection strategy of class \?IntVarBranch?,
\?vars.b? the second, \?vars.c? the third, and \?vars.d? the
forth and last to be used during tie-breaking.

Before creating the brancher, the variable selection strategies
are normalized. As mentioned earlier, there should be no
tie-breaking after the variable selection strategies
\?INT_VAR_NONE()? and \?INT_VAR_RND()? (corresponding to
\?SEL_NONE? and \?SEL_RND?, respectively). The normalization
first tries to normalize \?var.b?, then \?var.c? and finally
\?var.d? as follows (the \?var.c? and \?var.d? case is analogous
and hence omitted):
\insertlitcode{int.hh:normalizing tie-breaking}

After normalization, the \?branch()? function shown in
\autoref{fig:v:branch:branchtb} posts a brancher of 
class \gecoderef[class]{ViewValBrancher} with the appropriate
number of view selection objects. In
\autoref{fig:v:branch:branchtb}, only the cases for two and three objects is
shown the other cases are analogous.


\chapter{Putting everything together}
\label{chap:v:all}

This chapter finally explains how integer interval variables can
be used with Gecode. 

\paragraph{Overview.}

\mbox{}\autoref{sec:v:all:golomb} sketches an example script
together with implementations of constraints and branchings using
integer interval variables. The following section,
\autoref{sec:v:all:conf}, shows how Gecode can be configured to
use integer interval variables and how to compile and run the
example script.

\begin{important}
  Please make sure to carefully read
  \autoref{sec:m:started:compile}, before reading any further in
  this chapter!
\end{important}

\section{Golomb rulers  la integer interval variables}
\label{sec:v:all:golomb}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{putting everything together}
\caption{Golomb rulers  la integer interval variables}
\label{fig:v:all:golomb}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:v:all:golomb} shows the top-level structure of a
single \CPP-file containing a script together
with all required implementations of post functions, propagators,
and branchers. The example script implements a naive version of
the Golomb ruler model presented in \autoref{chap:c:golomb}. The
reason to package everything into a single \CPP-file is to
simplify compiling the example.

The implementations of the constraints in the \CPP-file are
carefully constructed to exercise most of the functionality
described in the previous chapters in this part. In particular,
some constraints have a slightly non-standard implementation to
exercise all views presented in \autoref{chap:v:view}.

\section{Configuring and compiling Gecode}
\label{sec:v:all:conf}

The following steps configure and compile Gecode with integer
interval variables:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start a shell.
\item Create a new directory, say \texttt{MPG}, and make it
  the current directory:
\begin{smallcmd}
mkdir MPG; cd MPG
\end{smallcmd}
\item Download a Gecode~\GecodeVersion{} source package or
  check-out Gecode~\GecodeVersion{} from \texttt{svn}. We assume
  that the Gecode source code is contained in a directory named
  \texttt{gecode-\GecodeVersion}.
\item If you have not yet done so, download and copy all files
  required for integer interval variables and the example into
  the current directory:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The header file \DOWNLOAD{int.hh}{\texttt{int.hh}} containing
    the implementation of integer interval variables.
  \item The variable implementation specification file
    \DOWNLOAD{int.vis}{\texttt{int.vis}}.
  \item The file
    \DOWNLOAD{putting-everything-together.cpp}{\texttt{putting-everything-together.cpp}}
    from the previous section.
  \end{itemize}
\item Configure Gecode to incorporate integer interval variables:
\smalllitcmdblock{\ttfamily
cd gecode-\GecodeVersion\\
./configure -{}-with-vis=../int.vis
}
After this step, Gecode has been configured to incorporate the
generated definitions as described by the specification file
\texttt{int.vis}. If you need to pass other options to
\?configure? to successfully build Gecode, please do so.
\item Compile Gecode and leave the directory
\smalllitcmdblock{\ttfamily
make;cd ..
}
\item 
\begin{samepage}
  Set the \texttt{PATH} environment variable to point to the
  just compiled Gecode installation: \smalllitcmdblock{\ttfamily export
    PATH="gecode-\GecodeVersion:\$PATH" }
\end{samepage}
Depending on the platform you use, you might also have to set the
environment variable \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} accordingly.
\end{enumerate}

Finally: compile, link, and run the example script
\texttt{putting-everything-together.cpp} as described in
\autoref{sec:m:started:run}, where you need to make sure that the
directory for include files and library files is
\texttt{gecode-\GecodeVersion}.

\chapter{Reification and rewriting}
\label{chap:p:reified}

This chapter discusses how to implement propagators for reified
constraints and how to optimize constraint propagation by
propagator rewriting. Gecode does not offer any special support
for reification but uses propagator rewriting as a more general
technique. 

\paragraph{Overview.}

The definition of a reified constraint and how it can be
propagated is reviewed in \autoref{sec:p:reified:overview}. The
following section (\autoref{sec:p:reified:leeq}) presents a
refied less or equal propagator as an example. General propagator
rewriting during constraint propagation is discussed in
\autoref{sec:p:reified:max}, whereas \autoref{sec:p:reified:or}
presents how to rewrite propagators during cloning.


\section{Reification}
\label{sec:p:reified:overview}

A propagator for the reified constraint $\reify{c}{\mathtt{b}}$
for a Boolean \emph{control variable} $\mathtt{b}$ propagates as
follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \?b? is \?1?, propagate $c$.
\item If \?b? is \?0?, propagate $\neg c$ (it is not always
  easy to propagate the negation of a constraint $c$
  effectively and efficiently).
\item If $c$ is subsumed, propagate that \?b? is \?1?.
\item If $\neg c$ is subsumed, propagate that \?b? is \?0?.
\end{enumerate}

The idea how to implement reification in Gecode is quite simple:
if the first (or second) case is true, the reified propagator
implementing the reified constraint rewrites itself into a
propagator for $c$ (or $\neg c$). The remaining two cases are
nothing but testing criteria for subsumption. 

The advantage of rewriting a reified propagator for
$\reify{c}{\mathtt{b}}$ into a non-reified propagator for $c$ or
$\neg c$ is that the propagators created by rewriting are
typically available anyway, and that after rewriting no more
overhead for reification is incurred.


\section{A reified less or equal propagator}
\label{sec:p:reified:leeq}

We will discuss a reified less or equal propagator $\reify{\mathtt
  x \leq \mathtt y}{\mathtt b}$ for integer variables \?x? and
\?y? as an example. Taking the above propagation rules for a
reified constraint, we obtain:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \?b? is \?1?, propagate $\mathtt x \leq \mathtt y$.
\item If \?b? is \?0?, propagate $\mathtt x > \mathtt y$
  (actually, we choose to propagate $\mathtt y < \mathtt x$ instead).
\item If $\mathtt x \leq \mathtt y$ is subsumed, propagate that \?b? is \?1?.
\item If $\mathtt x > \mathtt y$ is subsumed, propagate that \?b?
  is \?0?.
\item If none of the above rules apply, the propagator is at fixpoint.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{less or equal reified}
\caption{A constraint and propagator for reified less or equal}
\label{fig:p:reified:leeq}
\end{figure}

The propagator \?ReLeEq? for reified less or equal relies on
propagators \?Less? for less and \?LeEq? for less or equal (the
propagators are not shown, see \autoref{sec:p:started:patterns}
instead). The \?propagate()? function as shown in
\autoref{fig:p:reified:leeq} follows the propagation rules
sketched above.

\paragraph{Propagator rewriting.}

The \?GECODE_REWRITE? macro takes the propagator (here, \?*this?)
to be rewritten and an expression that posts the new propagator
as arguments. It relies on the fact that the identifier \?home?
refers to the current home space (like the fail macros in
\autoref{sec:p:started:better}). The macro expands to something
along the following lines:
\begin{code}
size_t s = this->dispose(home);
GECODE_ES_CHECK(LeEq::post(home(*this),x0,x1));
return home.ES_SUBSUMED_DISPOSED(*this,s);
\end{code}
That is, the \?ReLeEq? propagator is disposed, the new \?LeEq?
propagator is posted, and subsumption is reported. The order is
essential for performance: by first disposing \?ReLeEq?, the data
structures that store the subscriptions for \?x0? and \?x1? will
have at least one free slot for the subscriptions that are
created by posting \?LeEq? and hence avoid (rather inefficient
and memory consuming) resizing. Note that it is important to
understand that the old propagator is disposed before the new
propagator is posted. In case that some data structures that are
deleted during disposal are needed for posting, one either has to
make sure that the data structures outlive the call to \?dispose()?
or that one does not use the \?GECODE_REWRITE? macro but first
posts the new propagator and only then reports subsumption.

Another essential part is that after calling \?ES_SUBSUMED()?, a
propagator is not allowed to do anything that can schedule
propagators (such as performing modification operations or
creating subscriptions). That is the reason that first \?dispose()?
is called and later the special variant \?ES_SUBSUMED_DISPOSED()?
is used for actually reporting subsumption. Do not use
\?ES_SUBSUMED_DISPOSED()? unless you really, really have to!

\paragraph{Adding information to \?Home?.}

As has been discussed in \autoref{tip:m:started:home} and
\autoref{sec:p:started:better}, posting uses a value of class
\gecoderef[class]{Home} instead of a reference to a \?Space?. In
the expansion of \?GECODE_REWRITE? as shown above, the call
operator \?()? as in
\begin{code}
home(*this)
\end{code}
returns a new value of type \?Home? with the additional
information added that the propagator to be posted is in fact a
rewrite of the propagator \?*this?. This information is
important, for example, for inheriting the AFC (accumulated
failure count, see \autoref{sec:m:search:branch:int}): the newly
created propagator will inherit the number of accumulated
failures from the propagator being rewritten. There will be other
applications of \?Home? in future versions of Gecode.

\paragraph{Testing relations between views.}

Rather than testing whether $\mathtt{x0}\leq\mathtt{x1}$ or
$\mathtt{x0}>\mathtt{x1}$ hold individually, we use the function
\?Int::rtest_lq()? that tests whether two views are less or equal
and returns whether the relation holds (\?Int::RT_TRUE?), does
not hold (\?Int::RT_FALSE?), or might hold or not
(\?Int::RT_MAYBE?). 

Relation tests are available for two views (integer or Boolean)
or for a view (again, integer or Boolean) and an integer.
Relation tests exist for all inequality relations:
\?Int::rtest_le()? (for~$<$), \?Int::rtest_lq()? (for~$\leq$),
\?Int::rtest_gr()? (for~$>$), and \?Int::rtest_gq()?  (for~$\geq$).
For equality, a bounds test (\?Int::rtest_eq_bnd()?) as
well as a domain test exists (\?Int::rtest_eq_dom()?). While
\?Int::rtest_eq_bnd()? only uses the bounds for testing the
relation (with constant time complexity), \?Int::rtest_eq_dom()? uses the full set of values in the
domain of the views to determine the relation (having linear time
complexity in the length of the range representation of the
views' domains, see \autoref{sec:p:domain:iter} for more
information on range representations of view domains). The
same holds true for disequality: \?Int::rtest_nq_bnd()? performs
the bounds-only test, whereas \?Int::rtest_nq_dom()? performs the
full domain test. For example, \?Int::rtest_eq_bnd(x,y)? for
$\mathtt x\in\{0,2\}$ and $\mathtt y\in\{1,3\}$ returns
\?Int::RT_MAYBE?, whereas \?Int::rtest_eq_dom()? returns
\?Int::RT_FALSE?.

\paragraph{Reified propagator patterns.}

The integer module (as these patterns require Boolean views they
are part of the integer module)
provides reified propagator patterns for unary propagators
(\gecoderef[class]{Int::ReUnaryPropagator}) and binary
propagators (\gecoderef[class]{Int::ReBinaryPropagator} and
\gecoderef[class]{Int::ReMixBinaryPropagator}). In addition to
views \?x0? (and \?x1? for the binary variants), they define a
Boolean control variable \?b?. Please note that in
\autoref{fig:p:reified:leeq} a reified propagator pattern
requires an additional template argument for the Boolean control
view used (the mystery why this is useful is lifted in
\autoref{chap:p:views}).


\section{Rewriting during propagation}
\label{sec:p:reified:max}

Rewriting during propagation is a useful technique that is not
limited to implementing reification. We consider a \?Max?
propagator that propagates
$\max(\mathtt{x}_0,\mathtt{x}_1)=\mathtt{x}_2$. The propagation
rules (we are giving bounds propagation rules that achieve
\boundsz{} consistency, see~\cite{bounds-consistency}) for \?Max?
are easy to understand when looking at an equivalent formulation
of $\max$~\cite{SchulteStuckey:TOPLAS:2005}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\max(\mathtt{x}_0,\mathtt{x}_1)=\mathtt{x}_2
&\iff&
(\mathtt{x}_0\leq\mathtt{x}_2)\wedge
(\mathtt{x}_1\leq\mathtt{x}_2)\wedge
\left( (\mathtt{x}_0=\mathtt{x}_2)\vee(\mathtt{x}_1=\mathtt{x}_2)\right)\\
&\iff&
(\mathtt{x}_0\leq\mathtt{x}_2)\wedge
(\mathtt{x}_1\leq\mathtt{x}_2)\wedge
\left( (\mathtt{x}_0\geq\mathtt{x}_2)\vee(\mathtt{x}_1\geq\mathtt{x}_2)\right)\\
\end{eqnarray*}

Then, the propagation rules can be turned into
the following \CPP-code to be executed by the \?propagate()? member
function of \?Max?:
\begin{code}
GECODE_ME_CHECK(x2.lq(home,std::max(x0.max(),x1.max())));
GECODE_ME_CHECK(x2.gq(home,std::max(x0.min(),x1.min())));
GECODE_ME_CHECK(x0.lq(home,x2.max()));
GECODE_ME_CHECK(x1.lq(home,x2.max()));
if ((x1.max() <= x0.min()) || 
    (x1.max() < x2.min()))
  GECODE_ME_CHECK(x0.gq(home,x2.min()));
if ((x0.max() <= x1.min()) || 
    (x0.max() < x2.min()))
  GECODE_ME_CHECK(x1.gq(home,x2.min()));
\end{code}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{max using rewriting}
\caption{A maximum propagator using rewriting}
\label{fig:p:reified:max}
\end{figure}

Please take a second look: the condition of the first
\?if?-statement tests whether $\mathtt{x}_1$ is less or equal
than $\mathtt{x}_0$, or whether $\mathtt{x}_1$ is less than
$\mathtt{x}_2$. In both cases,
$\max(\mathtt{x}_0,\mathtt{x}_1)=\mathtt{x}_2$ simplifies to
$\mathtt{x}_0=\mathtt{x}_2$. Exactly this simplification can be
implemented by propagator rewriting, please check
\autoref{fig:p:reified:max}. Note that the propagator is naive in
that it does not implement the propagator to be idempotent (however,
this can be done exactly as demonstrated in
\autoref{sec:p:avoid:eqbnd}).

Another idea would be to perform rewriting during cloning: the
\?copy()? function could return an \?Equal? propagator rather than
a \?Max? propagator in the cases where rewriting is possible.
However, this is illegal: it would create a propagator with only
two views, hence one view would not be updated even though there
is a subscription for it (violating obligation ``update
complete'' from \autoref{sec:p:started:obligations}). Also,
canceling a subscription is illegal during cloning (violating
obligation ``cloning conservative'' from
\autoref{sec:p:started:obligations}). The next section shows an
example with opposite properties: rewriting during propagation
makes no sense (even though it would be legal) whereas rewriting
during cloning is legal and useful.


\section{Rewriting during cloning}
\label{sec:p:reified:or}

In \autoref{sec:p:avoid:dynamic}, the propagator \?OrTrue? is
simplified during copying by eliminating assigned views. Here we
show that the propagator created as a copy during cloning can be
optimized further by rewriting it during copying.

\begin{samepage}
\paragraph{Copying.}
The modified \?copy()? function is as follows:
\insertlitcode{or true using rewriting:copy}
\end{samepage}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{or true using rewriting}
\caption{A Boolean disjunction propagator using rewriting}
\label{fig:p:reified:or}
\end{figure}


The \?copy()? function takes advantage of two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If there is a view that is assigned to \?1?, the propagator
  is subsumed. However, during cloning a propagator cannot be
  deleted by subsumption. Reporting subsumption is only possible
  during propagation. The \?copy()? function does the next best
  thing: it creates a propagator \?SubsumedOrTrue? that next time
  it is executed will in fact report subsumption.
  
  Note that in this situation rewriting during cloning is
  preferable to rewriting during propagation. An important aspect
  of the \?OrTrue?  propagator is that it does not inspect all of
  its views during finding a view for resubscribing (as implemented
  by the \?resubscribe()? member function). Instead, inspection
  stops as soon as the first unassigned view is found. That
  entails that a view that is assigned to \?1? might be missed
  during propagation. In other words, rewriting during cloning
  also optimizes subsumption detection.
\item If all views in the view array \?x? are assigned to \?0?,
  the view array is actually not longer needed (it has no
  elements). In this case, the \?copy()? function creates
  a propagator \?BinaryOrTrue? that is a special variant of
  \?OrTrue? limited to just two views. Note that the two views
  \?x0? and \?x1? are known to be not yet assigned: otherwise,
  the propagator would not be at fixpoint. This is impossible as
  only spaces that are at fixpoint (and hence all of its
  propagators must be at fixpoint) can be cloned (this invariant
  is discussed in \autoref{sec:s:started:space}).
  
  Rewriting during propagation would be entirely pointless in
  this situation: the propagator (be it \?OrTrue? or
  \?BinaryOrTrue?) will be executed at most one more time and
  will become subsumed then (or, due to failure, it is not
  executed at all). As rewriting incurs the cost of creating and
  disposing propagators and subscriptions, rewriting in this case
  would actually slow down execution.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Constructors for copying.}

The relevant parts of the two special propagators for rewriting
\?SubsumedOrTrue? and \?BinaryOrTrue? are shown in
\autoref{fig:p:reified:or}. Their \?propagate()? functions are
exactly as sketched above. The only other non-obvious aspect are
the constructors used for copying during cloning: they are now
called for a propagator of class \?OrTrue?. In this example, it
is sufficient to have a single constructor for copying as all the
propagators \?OrTrue?, \?SubsumedOrTrue?, and \?BinaryOrTrue?
inherit from \?BinaryPropagator?. In other cases, it might be
necessary to have more than a single constructor for copying
defined by a propagator class \?C?: one for copying a propagator
of class \?C? and one for creating propagators as rewrites of
other propagators.

\chapter{Domain propagation}
\label{chap:p:domain}

The propagators in previous chapters use simple modification
operations on variable views in that only a single integer
defines how a view's domain is changed. When programming
propagators that perform more elaborate domain reasoning, these
modification operations are typically insufficient as they easily
lead to incorrect and inefficient propagators.

To conveniently program efficient propagators that perform domain
reasoning, Gecode offers modification operations that take entire
sets of integers as arguments. To be efficient, these sets are not
implemented as a typical set data structure but as
\emph{iterators}: the integers (or entire ranges of integers) can
be iterated in increasing order (smallest first). 

\paragraph{Overview.}

This chapters motivates why special domain operations on variable
views are needed (\autoref{sec:p:domain:crash}) and demonstrates
how iterators are used for domain propagation
(\autoref{sec:p:domain:iter} and
\autoref{sec:p:domain:iterators}). \autoref{sec:p:domain:med} and
\autoref{sec:p:domain:staging} describe modification event deltas
and staging for efficiently combining bounds with domain
propagation.


\section{Why domain operations are needed}
\label{sec:p:domain:crash}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{incorrect domain equal}
\caption{An incorrect propagator for domain equal}
\label{fig:p:domain:incorrect}
\end{figure}

Let us consider an attempt to implement domain propagation for an
equality constraint on views \?x0? and \?x1?. The idea for
pruning is simple: only keep those values of \?x0?
and \?x1? that are common to the domains of both \?x0? and \?x1?.
This leads to a first version of a domain equality propagator as
shown in \autoref{fig:p:domain:incorrect}. Beware, the ``propagator''
is not only naive but also incorrect: it will crash Gecode!

The propagator uses iterators of type \?Int::ViewValues? to
iterate over the values of an integer view in increasing order
(the template argument defines the type of the view to iterate
on).  The increment operator \?++? moves the iterator to the next
value, the application operator \?()? tests whether the iterator
has more values to iterate, and the function \?val()? returns the
iterator's current value.  The reason why the propagator will
crash is simple: it uses the iterator \?i? for iterating over the
values of \?x0? and modifies the domain of \?x0? while iterating!
This is illegal: when using an iterator for a view, the view
cannot be modified (or, in \CPP{} lingua: modifying the variable
invalidates the iterator).

One idea how to fix this problem is to use a temporary data
structure in which the newly computed intersection domain is
stored.  That is not very tempting: allocating and initializing
an intermediate data structure is costly.

But even then, the approach is flawed from the beginning: a
single \?nq()? operation on a view has linear runtime in the size
of the view's domain (actually, in the length of its range
sequence, see below). As potentially a linear number of \?nq()?
operations are executed, the propagator will have quadratic
complexity even though it should have linear (as the values of
the domains are available in strictly increasing order).



\section{Iterator-based modification operations}
\label{sec:p:domain:iter}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{naive domain equal}
\caption{A naive propagator for domain equal}
\label{fig:p:domain:naive}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:p:domain:naive} shows a working, yet still naive,
implementation of an equality propagator performing domain
reasoning. Note that the \?cost()? function is overridden: even
though the propagator is binary, it now incurs a higher cost due
to the domain operations to be performed. The \?propagate()?
function uses two \emph{range iterators} for iterating over the
range sequence of the domains of \?x0? and \?x1?. For the
definition of a range sequence, see \autoref{sec:m:int:iter}.

A \emph{range iterator} for a range sequence $s=\rseqc{n}{m}{k}$
is an object that provides iteration over $s$: each of the
$\range{m_i}{n_i}$ can be obtained in sequential order but only
one at a time. A range iterator provides the following
operations: the application operator \?()? tests whether there
are more ranges to iterate, the increment operator \?++? moves to
the next range, the function \?min()? (\?max()?) returns the
smallest (largest) value of the current range, and the function
\?width()? returns the \emph{width} of the current range (that
is, its number of elements) as an unsigned integer.

The motivation to iterate over range sequences rather than
individual values is efficiency: as there are typically less
ranges than indvidual values, iteration over ranges can be more
efficient. Moreover, many operations are sufficiently easy to
express in terms of ranges rather than values (see
\autoref{sec:p:domain:iterators} for an example).

\paragraph{Iterator-based modification operations.}

The propagator uses two modification operations for range
iterators: \?x1.inter_r()? intersects the current domain of \?x1?
with the set defined by the range iterator \?r0? for \?x0?. After
this operation (provided no failure occurred), the view \?x1? has
the correct domain: the intersection of the domains of \?x0? and
\?x1?. The operation \?x0.narrow_r()? replaces the current domain
of \?x0? by the set defined by the range iterator \?r1? (which
iterates the intersection of the domains of \?x0? and \?x1?).

A third operation available for range iterators is \?minus_r()?
which removes the values as described by the range iterator
passed as argument.

Instead of using range iterators for modification operations, one
can also use value iterators instead. Similarly, a view provides
operations \?inter_v()?, \?narrow_v()?, and \?minus_v()? for
intersecting, replacing, and removing values.

\tip{Narrow is dangerous}{The \?narrow_r()? operation used in the
  above example is dangerous (as is the \?narrow_v()? operation).
  As discussed in \autoref{sec:p:started:obligations}, a
  propagator must be contracting: the domain of a view is only
  allowed to get smaller. If \?narrow_r()? is used incorrectly,
  then one could actually replace the view's domain by a larger domain.

In the above example, the propagator is contracting: \?r1?
refers to the intersection of \?x0? and \?x1?, which of course
has no more values than \?x0?.}

\tip{Iterators must be increasing}{
The range sequence iterated by a range iterator \emph{must} be
sorted in increasing order and \emph{must} not overlap as
described above. Otherwise, domain operations using range
iterators become incorrect.

For value iterators, the values must be increasing in value with
iteration. But it is okay if the same value is iterated over
multiply. That is, the values must be increasing but not
necessarily strictly increasing.  }

\paragraph{Avoiding shared iterators.}

The problem that made our attempt to implement propagation for
equality in \autoref{sec:p:domain:crash} incorrect is to use
iterators for iterating over views that are simultaneously
modified.

Iterator-based modification operations automatically take care of
potential sharing between the iterator they use and the view
domain they update. By default, an iterator-based modification
operation assumes that iterator and domain are shared. The
operation first constructs a new domain and iterates to the end
of the iterator.  Only then the old domain is replaced by the newly
constructed domain. In many cases, however, there is no sharing
between iterator and domain and the operations could be performed
more efficiently by in-place update operations on the domain.

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{non-shared domain equal}
\caption{A propagator for domain equal without sharing}
\label{fig:p:domain:nonshared}
\end{figure}

In our example, there is no sharing if the views \?x0? and \?x1?
do not refer to the very same variable implementation. If they
do, the propagator should not even be posted as it is subsumed
anyway (views of the same type referring to the same variable
implementation are trivially equal).
\autoref{fig:p:domain:nonshared} shows the propagator post
function of an improved propagator for equality: the propagator
is posted only if \?x0? and \?x1? do not refer to the same
variable implementation.  The \?propagate()? function is improved
by giving an additional \?false? argument to both \?inter_r()?
and \?narrow_r()?. Hence, the two operations use more efficient
operations performing in-place updates on domains.


\section{Taking advantage of iterators}
\label{sec:p:domain:iterators}

This section shows how the combination of simple iterators can
help in implementing domain propagation. 

Suppose that we want to implement a close variant of the equality
constraint, namely $x=y+c$ for integer variables $x$ and $y$ and
some integer value $c$. It is easy to see that the new domain for
$x$ must be all values of $x$ intersected with the values
$\setc{n+c}{n\in y}$. Likewise, the new domain for $y$ must be
all values of $y$ intersected with the values $\setc{n-c}{n\in
  x}$. But how can we implement these simple
propagation rules?

\paragraph{Mapping range sequences.}

Assume a range sequence $\seqc{\range{m_i}{n_i}}{i=0}{k}$ for the
values in the domain of $y$. Then, what we want to compute is a
range sequence $$\seqc{\range{m_i+c}{n_i+c}}{i=0}{k}.$$ With other
words, we want to map the first into the second range sequence.
Luckily, this is easy. Suppose that \?r? is a range iterator for
the view \?y?. A range iterator for our desired
range sequence can be constructed using the \?Iter::Range::Map?
iterator and an object that describes how to map the ranges of
\?r? to the desired ranges.

For this, we define the following class:
\insertlitcode{domain equal with offset:offset map}

\?OffsetMap? defines to which values the minimum (\?min()?) and
the maximum (\?max()?) of each input range must be mapped. Using
\?OffsetMap?, we can construct a range iterator \?m? for our
desired sequence by
\begin{code}
OffsetMap om(c);
Iter::Ranges::Map<Int::ViewRanges<Int::IntView>,
                  OffsetMap> m(r,om);
\end{code}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{domain equal with offset}
\caption{A propagator for domain equal with offset}
\label{fig:p:domain:offset}
\end{figure}

With the help of the map range iterator, propagation for
\?OffsetEqual? as shown in \autoref{fig:p:domain:offset} is
straightforward. Note that several functions need to be modified
to deal with the additional integer constant \?c? used by the
propagator (the details can be inspected by downloading
the full program code). Further note that the constraint post
function is slightly to liberal in that it does not check whether
the values with the integer constant \?c? added exceed the limits
for legal integer values.

While the propagator is reasonably easy to construct using map
iterators, \autoref{sec:p:views:int:offset} shows how to obtain
exactly the same propagator without any programming effort but
the implementation of an additional constraint post function.

\paragraph{Using and defining iterators.}

Gecode comes with a multitude of range and value iterators to
transform range and value sequences of other iterators. These
iterators are defined in the namespace
\gecoderef[namespace]{Iter}. Range iterators are defined in
the namespace \gecoderef[namespace]{Iter::Ranges} and value
iterators in the namespace
\gecoderef[namespace]{Iter::Values}. Example iterators include:
iterators to convert value into range iterators and vice versa,
iterators to compute the union and intersection, iterators to
iterate over arrays and bitsets, just to name a few.

But even if the predefined iterators are not sufficient, it is
straightforward to implement new iterators: the only
requirement is that they implement the appropriate interface
mentioned above for range or value iterators. The namespace
\gecoderef[namespace]{Iter} contains a multitude of simple and
advanced examples.

\paragraph{Benefits of iterators.}

The true benefit of using iterators for performing value or range
transformations is that the iterator-based domain modification
operation with which an iterator is used is automatically
specialized at compile time. Typically, no
intermediate data structures are created and the modification
operations are optimized at compile time for each individual
iterator.\footnote{Some predefined iterators actually have to
  resort to intermediate data structures. For example,
  iterators that need to revert the order of its values or ranges
  (think of a value iterator for values that are the
  negation of values of some other value iterator).}

A scenario where this in particular matters is when iterators are
used as \emph{adaptors} of a propagator-specific data structure. Assume
that a propagator uses a specific (typically, quite involved)
data structure to perform propagation. Most often this data
structure encodes in some form which views should take which
values. Then, one can implement simple iterators that inspect the
propagator-specific data structure and provide the information
about values for views so that they can be used directly with
iterator-based modification operations. Again, intermediate
data structures are avoided by this approach.



\section{Modification event deltas}
\label{sec:p:domain:med}

There is a rather obvious approach to improving the efficiency of
domain operations performed by propagators: make the domains as
small as possible! One typical approach to reduce the size of the
domains is to perform bounds propagation first. After bounds
propagation, the domains are likely to be smaller and hence the
domain operations are likely to be more efficient.

For propagating equality, the simplest idea is to first perform
bounds propagation for equality as discussed in
\autoref{sec:p:avoid:eqbnd}, directly followed by domain
propagation. However, we can improve further by exploiting an
additional token of information about the views of a propagator
that is supplied to both the \?cost()? and \?propagate()?
function of a propagator.

The \?cost()? and \?propagate()? functions of a propagator take an
additional \emph{modification event delta} value of type
\?ModEventDelta? (see \gecoderef[group]{TaskActor}) as argument.
Every propagator maintains a modification event delta that
describes how its views have changed since the last time the
propagator has been executed. For each view type
(that is, integer, Boolean, set, $\ldots$) a modification event
delta stores a modification event that can be extracted from the
modification event delta: If \?med? is a modification event delta, then
\?Int::IntView::me(med)? returns the modification event for
integer views.

The extracted modification event describes how all views of a
certain view type have changed. For example, for integer
views, the modification event \?Int::ME_INT_VAL? signals that
there is at least one integer view that has been assigned
since the propagator has been executed last (analogous for
\?Int::ME_INT_BND? and \?Int::ME_INT_DOM?). Even the modification
event \?Int::ME_INT_NONE? carries some information: none of the
propagator's integer views have been modified (which, of
course, can only happen if the propagator also uses views of
some other type).

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{domain equal using bounds propagation}
\caption{A propagator for domain equal using bounds propagation}
\label{fig:p:domain:bounds}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:p:domain:bounds} shows a propagator that combines
both bounds and domain propagation for propagating equality. It
first extracts the modification event for integer views from the
modification event delta \?med?. Only if the bounds (that is,
modification events \?Int::ME_INT_VAL? or \?Int::ME_INT_BND?,
hence different from \?Int::ME_INT_DOM?) have changed for at
least one of the views \?x0? and \?x1?, the propagator performs
bounds propagation.

After performing bounds propagation, the propagator checks
whether it is subsumed. Then it does some more fixpoint
reasoning: if the domains of \?x0? and \?x1? are ranges (that is,
they do not have holes), the propagator is at fixpoint.
Otherwise, domain propagation is done as shown before.


\section{Staging}
\label{sec:p:domain:staging}

Taking the perspective of a single propagator, first performing
bounds propagation directly followed by domain propagation seems
to be appropriate. However, when taking into account that some
other cheap propagators (at least cheaper than performing domain
propagation by this propagator) might already be able to take
advantage of the results of bounds propagation, it might actually
be better to postpone domain propagation and give cheaper
propagators the opportunity to execute. This idea is known as
\emph{staging} and has been introduced in
Gecode~\cite[Section~7]{SchulteStuckey:TOPLAS:2008}.  Note that
staging is not limited to bounds and domain propagation
but captures any stages in propagation that differ in cost.

Here, we focus on staging for first performing bounds
propagation (stage ``bounds'') and then domain propagation (stage
``domain'') for equality. Additionally, a propagator can be idle
(stage ``idle''). The stage of a propagator is controlled by how
its modification event delta changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Initially, the propagator is idle, its modification event
  delta is empty, and the propagator is in stage ``idle''.
\item When the modification event delta for integer views changes
  to \?Int::ME_INT_DOM? and the propagator is in stage ``idle'',
  the propagator is put into stage ``domain'' with high
  propagation cost.
\item When the modification event delta for integer views changes
  to \?Int::ME_INT_VAL? or \?Int::ME_INT_BND?, the propagator is
  put into stage ``bounds'' with low propagation cost.
  
  Note that this in particular includes the case where the
  modification event delta for integer views has been
  \?Int::ME_INT_DOM? and where the propagator had already been in
  stage ``domain''. As soon as the modification event delta
  changes to \?Int::ME_INT_BND? or \?Int::ME_INT_VAL? the
  propagator is put into stage ``bounds''.
\end{itemize}

By the very construction of modification event deltas, the
modification event delta for integer views can neither change
from \?Int::ME_INT_VAL? to \?Int::ME_INT_BND? nor from
\?Int::ME_INT_BND? (or \?Int::ME_INT_VAL?) to \?Int::ME_INT_DOM?.
That is, if the equality propagator using staging is in stage
``bounds'' it stays in that stage until it is executed.

\caption{Stage transitions for the equality propagator}
\label{fig:p:domain:transitions}
\end{figure}

When the propagator is executed, it can be either in stage
``bounds'' or stage ``domain''. If it is executed in stage
``bounds'', it performs bounds propagation and then returns that
it wants to be put into stage ``domain''. The essential point is that
the propagator does not continue with domain propagation but gives other
propagators the opportunity to execute first. If the propagator is
executed in stage ``domain'', it performs domain propagation and
returns that it is at fixpoint (and hence the propagator is put
into stage ``idle''). \autoref{fig:p:domain:transitions}
summarizes the stage transitions, where a blue transition is
triggered by a change in the modification event delta
(\?Int::ME_INT_DOM? is abbreviated by \?DOM? and so on) and a green
transition is performed be executing the propagator.

\paragraph{Rescheduling propagators.}

The cost of a propagator depends on its modification event delta.
This connection goes even further: only if the modification event
delta of a propagator changes, a propagator is rescheduled
according to its cost by recomputing the \?cost()? function.

Not recomputing cost each time a propagator might be scheduled is
done for two reasons. First, the number of possibly expensive
cost computations is reduced. Second, always rescheduling would
also violate the fairness among all propagators already scheduled
with same cost. If a propagator is scheduled often, it would be
penalized as its execution would be deferred.

\autoref{sec:p:advisors:force} discusses a technique to force
rescheduling of a propagator, irrespective of its modification
event delta.

\paragraph{Controlling staging by modification event deltas.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{domain equal using staging}
\caption{A propagator for domain equal using staging}
\label{fig:p:domain:staging}
\end{figure}

The \?cost()? function and the essential parts of the \?propagate()?
function of a propagator that uses staging to combine bounds and
domain propagation for equality are shown in
\autoref{fig:p:domain:staging}.

The \?cost()? function returns the cost based on the modification
event delta \?med?: if \?med? only includes \?Int::ME_INT_DOM?,
then the propagator returns that next time it executes, it executes at
high-binary cost (according to stage ``domain''). Otherwise, the
propagator returns that next time it executes, it executes at low-binary
cost (according to stage ``bounds'').

The \?propagate()? function is almost identical to the function
shown in the previous section. The only difference is that
\?propagate()? returns after having performed bounds
propagation. The call to \?ES_FIX_PARTIAL()? specifies that the
current propagator \?*this? has computed a partial fixpoint for
all modification events but \?Int::ME_INT_DOM?. The function
\?Int::IntView::med? creates a modification event delta from a
modification event for integer views. As an effect, the
modification event delta of the current propagator is set to
include nothing but \?Int::ME_INT_DOM? and the propagator is
scheduled: as defined by the \?cost()? function, the propagator is
scheduled for high binary cost. That means that other propagators
of lower cost might be executed first.

\paragraph{Constructing modification event deltas.}

Every view type provides a static \?med()? function that translates a
modification event of that view type into a modification event
delta. Modification event deltas for different view types can be
combined with the \?|? operator. For example, the following
expression combines the modification event \?ME_INT_BND? for
integer views with the modification event \?ME_BOOL_VAL? for
Boolean views:
\begin{code}
Int::IntView::med(ME_INT_BND) | Int::BoolView::med(ME_BOOL_VAL) 
\end{code}
Note that only modification event deltas for different view types can
be combined using \?|?.

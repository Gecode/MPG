\chapter{Getting started}
\label{chap:m:started}

This chapter provides a basic overview of how to program,
compile, link, and execute a constraint model in Gecode. The
chapter restricts itself to the fundamental concepts available in
Gecode, the following chapter presents functionality that makes
programming models more comfortable.

\paragraph{Overview.}

\mbox{}\autoref{sec:m:started:first} explains the basics of how a
model is programmed in Gecode. This is followed in
\autoref{sec:m:started:search} by a discussion of how search is
used to find solutions of a model. How a model is compiled,
linked, and executed is explained for several different operating
systems in \autoref{sec:m:started:run}.
\autoref{sec:m:started:gist} shows how Gist as a graphical and
interactive search tool can be used for developing constraint
models. Search for a best
solution of a model is explained in \autoref{sec:m:started:search-best}.

The chapter also includes an explanation of how to obtain Gecode
in \autoref{sec:m:started:obtain} which covers both installation
of binary packages available for some platforms and compilation
of source packages. There is no need to say, that this section is
very important reading!


\section{A first Gecode model}
\label{sec:m:started:first}

Models in Gecode are implemented using \emph{spaces}. A space is
\emph{home} to the \emph{variables}, \emph{propagators}
(implementations of constraints), \emph{branchers}
(implementations of branchings, describing
the search tree's shape, also known as labelings), and --
possibly -- an \emph{order} determining a best solution during
search.

Not surprisingly in an object-oriented language such as \CPP, an
elegant approach to programming a model is by inheritance: a model
inherits from the class \gecoderef[class]{Space} (implementing
spaces) and the subclass constructor implements the model. In
addition to the constructor, a model must implement a copy
constructor and a copy function such that search for that model
works (to be discussed later).

\paragraph{Send More Money.}

The model we choose as an example is Send More Money: find
distinct digits for the letters $S$, $E$, $N$, $D$, $M$, $O$,
$R$, and $Y$ such that the well-formed equation (no leading
zeros) $SEND+MORE=MONEY$ holds.

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{send more money}
\caption{A Gecode model for Send More Money}
\label{fig:m:started:smm}
\end{figure}

The program (with some parts yet to be presented) is shown in
\autoref{fig:m:started:smm}. Note that clicking a blue line
starting with $\blacktriangleright$ jumps to the corresponding
code. Clicking {\bfseries\textsc{[download]}} in the upper right
corner of the program provides access to the complete program
text.

The program starts by including the relevant Gecode headers. To
use integer variables and constraints, it includes
\CppInline{\litstr{<gecode/int.hh>}} and to access search engines
it includes \CppInline{\litstr{<gecode/search.hh>}}. All Gecode
functionality is in the scope of the namespace
\gecoderef[namespace]{Gecode}, for convenience the program makes
all functionality of the Gecode namespace visible by 
\?using namespace Gecode?.

As discussed, the model is implemented as the class
\?SendMoreMoney? inheriting from the class
\gecoderef[class]{Space}. It declares an array \?l? of integer
variables and initializes this array to have \?8? newly created
integer variables as elements, where each variable in the array
can take values from \?0? to \?9?.  Note that the constructor for
the variable array \?l? takes the current space (that is,
\?*this?)  as first argument. This is very common: any function
that depends on a space takes the current space as argument
(called \emph{home space})
Examples are constructors for
variables and variable arrays, functions that post constraints,
and functions that post branchings.

To simplify the posting of constraints, the constructor defines a
variable of type \gecoderef[class]{IntVar} for each letter. Note
the difference between creating a new integer variable (as done
with creating the array of integer variables together with
creating a new integer variable for each array element) and
referring to the same integer variable through different \CPP{}
variables of type \gecoderef[class]{IntVar}. This difference is
discussed in more detail in \autoref{sec:m:integer:var}.

\paragraph{Posting constraints.}

For each constraint there is a \emph{constraint post function} that creates
\emph{propagators} implementing the constraint (in the
home space that is passed as argument). 

\tip{\?Space&? versus \?Home?}{
\label{tip:m:started:home}%
Actually, when you check the
  reference documentation, you will see that these functions do
  not take an argument of type \?Space&? but of type \?Home?
  instead. An object of type \?Home? actually stores a reference
  to a space of type \?Space&? (and a reference
  of type \?Space&? is automatically coerced to an object
  of type \?Home?). Additionally, a \?Home? object might store
  other information that is useful for posting propagators and
  branchers. However, this is nothing you need to be concerned
  with when modeling with Gecode. Just think that \?Home? reads as
  \?Space&?. 
  Using \?Home? is important when programming propagators and
  branchers, see \autoref{par:p:started:home}.  }

The first constraints to be posted enforce that the equation is
well formed in that it has no leading zeros:
\insertlitcode{send more money:no leading zeros}

The family of \?rel? post functions (functions with
name \?rel? overloaded with different argument types)
implements simple relation constraints such as equality,
inequalities, and disequality (see \autoref{sec:m:integer:rel:int}
and \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntRelInt}). The constant
\?IRT_NQ?  requests a disequality constraint.

All letters are constrained to take pairwise distinct values by
posting a \?distinct? constraint (also known
as \?alldifferent? constraint):
\insertlitcode{send more money:all letters distinct}
See \autoref{sec:m:integer:distinct} and
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntDistinct} for more information on
the \?distinct? constraint.

The constraint that $SEND+MORE=MONEY$ is posted as a linear
equation where the individual letters are scaled to their
appropriate decimal positions:
\insertlitcode{send more money:linear equation}

The \?linear? constraint (which, again, exists in many
overloaded variants) posts the linear equation (as
instructed by \?IRT_EQ?)
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{|\mathtt{c}|-1} \mathtt{c}_i\cdot\mathtt{x}_i = 0
$$
with coefficients \?c?, integer variables \?x?, and right-hand
side constant
$0$ (see \autoref{sec:m:integer:linear} and
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntLI}). Here, $|\mathtt c|$
denotes the size (the number of elements) of the array \?c?
(which can be computed by \?c.size()?). Post functions are
designed to be as general as possible, hence the variant of
\?linear? that
takes an array of coefficients and an array of integer variables
as arguments. Other variants of \?linear? exist that do not take
coefficients (all coefficients are one) or accept an integer
variable as the right-hand side instead of an integer constant.

Note that the linear equation could have been expressed simpler
by using standard initializer lists as in:
\begin{code}
IntArgs c({         1000,  100,  10,  1,
                    1000,  100,  10,  1,
           -10000, -1000, -100, -10, -1});
IntVarArgs x({         s,    e,   n,  d,
                       m,    o,   r,  e,
                 m,    o,    n,   e,  y});
\end{code}

\autoref{sec:m:comfy:expr} demonstrates additional support for
posting linear expressions constructed from the usual arithmetic
operators such as \?+?, \?-?, and \?*?.


\paragraph{Posting branchings.}

Branchings determine the shape of the search tree. Common
branchings take a variable array of the variables to be assigned
values during search, a variable selection strategy, and a value
selection strategy. 

Here, we select the
variable with a smallest domain size first (\?INT_VAR_SIZE_MIN()?) and
assign the smallest value of the selected variable first
(\?INT_VAL_MIN()?):
\insertlitcode{send more money:post branching}

A \emph{branching} is implemented by a \emph{brancher} (like a
constraint is implemented by a propagator). A brancher creates a
number of \emph{choices} where each choice is defined by a number
of \emph{alternatives}. For example, the brancher posted above
will create as many choices as needed to assign all variables in
the integer variable array \?l?. Each of the choices is based on
the variable selected by the brancher, say $x$, and the value
selected by the brancher, say $n$. Then the alternatives of a
choice are $x=n$ and $x\neq n$ and are tried by search in that
order.

A space can have several branchers, where the brancher that is
posted first is also used first for search. More information on
branchings can be found in \autoref{chap:m:branch}.

\paragraph{Search support.}

As mentioned before, a space must implement an additional \?copy()?
function that is capable of returning a fresh copy during search.
Search in Gecode is based on a hybrid of \emph{recomputation} and
\emph{cloning} (see \autoref{chap:m:search}). Cloning during search
relies on the capability of a space to create a copy of itself.

To avoid confusion, by \emph{cloning} we refer to the entire
process of creating a clone of a space. By \emph{copying}, we
refer to the creation of a copy of a particular object during
cloning, for example, a variable or a space.

\insertlitcode{send more money:search support}

The actual \?copy()? function is straightforward and uses an
additional copy constructor. The \?copy()? function is virtual
such that cloning (used on behalf of a search engine) can create
a copy of a space even though the space's exact subclass is not
known to cloning. 

The obligation of the copy constructor is to invoke the copy
constructor of the parent class, and to copy all data
structures that contain variables. For
\?SendMoreMoney? this amounts to invoking \?Space(s)? and
updating the variable array. An exception of type 
\gecoderef[class]{SpaceNotCloned} is thrown if the copy
constructor of the \?Space? class is not invoked.
Please keep in mind that the copy constructor is run on the copy
being created and is passed the space that needs to be copied as
argument. Hence, updating the variable array \?l? in the copy
copies the array \?s.l?  from the space \?s? being cloned
(including all variables contained in the array).  More on
updating variables and variable arrays can be found in
\autoref{sec:m:integer:update}.

\tip{What is allowed during cloning}{
\label{tip:m:started:cloneallowed}%
In the copy constructor used during cloning the only thing that
is allowed, is to update variables and other data structures. No
new variables can be created and also no new constraints or
branchers can be posted.
}

\tip{Do not use the copy constructor directly}{
\label{tip:m:started:donotusecopyconstructor}%
The copy constructor for a Space is not enough to create a fully
initialized clone, and therefore you should not call it directly. The
same goes for the copy member function. If
you do need to create a clone, the clone member of
\gecoderef[class]{Space} should be used.
}


\paragraph{Printing solutions.}

Finally, the following prints the
variable array \?l?:
\insertlitcode{send more money:print solution}

In a real application, one would use the solution in
some other parts of the program. The point is that the space acts
as a \emph{closure} for the solution variables: the space maps
member names to objects. The space for
an actual solution is typically different from the space created
initially.  This is due to the fact that search for a solution
returns a space that has been obtained by constraint propagation
and cloning. The space members that refer to the solution
variables (the member \?l? in our example) provide the means to
access a solution independent of a particular space.


\section{Searching for solutions}
\label{sec:m:started:search}

Let us assume that we want to search for all solutions and that
search is controlled by the main function of our program. Search
consists of two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item create a model and a search engine for that model; and
\item use the search engine to find all solutions.
\end{itemize}
Hence, our main function looks as follows:
\insertlitcode{send more money:main function}

Creating a model is almost obvious: create an object of the
subclass of \gecoderef[class]{Space} that implements the model.
Then, create a search engine (we will be using a search engine
\gecoderef[class]{DFS} for depth-first search) and initialize it
with a model. Search engines are generic with respect to the type
of model, implemented as a template in \CPP. Hence, we use a
search engine of type \?DFS<SendMoreMoney>? for the model
\?SendMoreMoney?. 

When the engine is initialized, it takes a clone of the model
passed to it (\?m? in our example). As the engine takes a clone,
several engines can be used without recreating the model. As we
are interested in a single engine, we immediately delete the
model \?m? after the search engine has been initialized.

\insertlitcode{send more money:create model and search engine}

\tip{Propagation is explicit}{%
\label{tip:m:started:status}
\begin{samepage}
A common misconception is that constraint propagation is
performed as soon as a space is created or as soon as a
constraint is posted. Executing the following code
\begin{code}
SendMoreMoney* m = new SendMoreMoney;
m->print();
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
\begin{samepage}
prints
\begin{cmd}
{[1..9], [0..9], [0..9], [0..9], [1..9], [0..9], [0..9], [0..9]}
\end{cmd}
\end{samepage}
That is, only very simple and cheap propagation (nothing but modifying the
domain of some variables) has been performed.

Constraint propagation is \emph{explicit} and must be requested
by the \?status()? member function of a space (the function also
returns information about the result of propagation but this is
of no concern here). Requesting propagation by
\begin{code}
(void) m->status();
m->print();
\end{code}
prints
\begin{cmd}
{9, [4..7], [5..8], [2..8], 1, 0, [2..8], [2..8]}
\end{cmd}
}

A search engine first performs constraint propagation as only
spaces that have been propagated can be cloned (so as to not
duplicate propagation for the original and for the clone).

The \?DFS<SendMoreMoney>? search engine has a simple interface:
the engine features a \?next()? function that returns the next
solution or \?NULL? if no more solutions exist. As we are
interested in all solutions, a while loop iterates over all
solutions that are found by the search engine:
\insertlitcode{send more money:search and print all solutions}

As you can see, a solution is nothing but a model again. A search
engine ensures that constraint propagation is performed and that
all variables are assigned as described by the branching(s) of
the model passed to the search engine. When a search engine
returns a model, the responsibility to delete the solution model is
with the client of the search engine.

It is straightforward to see how one would search for a single
solution instead: replace \?while? by \?if?.
\gecoderef[class]{DFS} is but one search engine and the behavior
of a search engine can be configured (for example: how cloning or
recomputation is used; how search can be interrupted) and it can
be queried for statistical information. Search engines are
discussed in more detail in \autoref{chap:m:search}.

\tip{Catching Gecode exceptions}{%
  Posting constraints, posting branchings, creating variables, and
  so on with Gecode might throw exceptions (for example,
  potential numerical overflow, illegal use of arguments). It is
  good practice to construct your programs right from the start
  to catch all these exceptions.

  That is, you should wrap the entire body of the main function
  but the \?return? statement into a \?try? statement as follows:
\begin{code}
try {
  ...
} catch (Exception e) {
  std::cerr << "Gecode exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
  return 1;
}
return 0;
\end{code}
  Even though this is good practice, the example programs in this
  document do not follow this advice, so as to keep the programs more
  readable.
}

\section{Compiling, linking, and executing}
\label{sec:m:started:run}

This section assumes that you have Gecode with the right version
(this document uses Gecode~\GecodeVersion) already installed on
your computer. If that is not the case, you should visit the
\AURL{https://www.gecode.org/download.html}{download section} on
Gecode's website and read \autoref{sec:m:started:obtain} on how
to install and/or compile Gecode. 

Naturally, the following sections are platform-specific.

\subsection{Microsoft Visual Studio}
\label{sec:m:started:windows}

Gecode uses a technique called auto-linking with Visual Studio:
by including Gecode header files, the compiler/linker knows which
library and DLL must be linked against. Hence, it is sufficient
to provide information to the compiler where the libraries
reside.

The library and DLL names encode the Gecode version, the platform
(\?x86?, \?x64?, or \?ia64?), and whether Gecode has been built
as release (optimized) or debug. That has the advantage that a
single set of header files can be shared among different
platforms and builds and the appropriate libraries and DLLs are
selected automatically.

In the following we assume that you are using one of the pre-compiled
Windows packages we provide (see \autoref{sec:m:started:install:windows}). The packages define the environment
variable \?%GECODEDIR%? where Gecode has been installed, and 
update the \?Path? environment variable so that Gecode DLLs are
found for execution.

\paragraph{Commandline.}

In the following we assume that you use the Visual Studio Command
Prompt.  When compiling and linking with \?cl?, you have to take
the following into account:
\begin{itemize}
\item As Gecode uses exceptions, you have to add \?/EHsc? as
  option on the commandline.
\item You have to link dynamically against multithreaded
  libraries. That is, you have to add to the commandline either
  \?/MD? (release build) or \?/MDd? (debug build).
\item If you want a release build, you need to switch off
  assertions by defining \?/DNDEBUG?.
\item You should instruct the compiler \?cl? to search for the
  Gecode header
  files by adding \?/I"%GECODEDIR%\include"? as an option.
\item When using \?cl? for linking, you should add at
  the very end of the commandline: \?/link /LIBPATH:"%GECODEDIR%\lib"?.
\item By default, \?cl? warns if \?this? is used in an
  initializer list (Gecode uses this for the initialization of
  variables and variable arrays). You can suppress the warning by
  passing \?/wd4355?.
\end{itemize}

The full command for compiling \?send-more-money.cpp? as a
release build (including optimization with \?/Ox?) is
\begin{cmd}
cl /DNDEBUG /EHsc /MD /Ox /wd4355 -I"%GECODEDIR%\include" \
  -c -Fosend-more-money.obj -Tpsend-more-money.cpp
\end{cmd}
where the \?\? at the end of a line means that the line actually
continues on the next line. The following command links the
program:
\begin{cmd}
cl /DNDEBUG /EHsc /MD /Ox /wd4355 -I"%GECODEDIR%\include" \
  -Fesend-more-money.exe send-more-money.obj \
  /link /LIBPATH:"%GECODEDIR%\lib"
\end{cmd}

\paragraph{Integrated development environment.}

When your Microsoft Visual Studio solution uses Gecode, all
necessary settings can be configured in the properties dialog of
your solution. We assume that Gecode is installed in the default
location \?"<GECODEDIR>"?.
\begin{itemize}
\item You must use dynamic linking against a multithreaded
  library. That is, either \?/MD? (release build) or \?/MDd?
  (debug build).  Depending on whether \?/MD? or \?/MDd? is used,
  release or debug libraries and DLLs will be used automatically.
\item As Gecode uses exceptions, you have to enable
  \?/EHsc? as option (this is true by default).
\item If you want a release build, you have to switch off
  assertions by defining \?/DNDEBUG? (this is true by default).
\item Configuration Properties, \CPP, General: set the
  "Additional Include Directories" to include 
  \?"$(GECODEDIR)\include"? as the directory
  containing the Gecode header files.
\item Configuration Properties, Linker, General: set the
  "Additional Library Directories" to 
  \?"$(GECODEDIR)\lib"? as the path containing the
  libraries.
\end{itemize}

\tip{Cygwin with Microsoft Visual Studio}{%
\label{tip:m:started:cygwin}%
  A setup that works well for us is to install
  \AURL{http://www.cygwin.com}{Cygwin} and Microsoft Visual
  Studio (Microsoft distributes a free
  \AURL{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/}{Community Edition}). 
  
  The easiest way to use the Microsoft Visual Studio \CPP{}
  compiler (\?cl?) from Cygwin is to add a line that loads the
  file \?vcvarsall.bat? to the
  \?Cygwin.bat? file that starts Cygwin. The file  \?vcvarsall.bat? comes
  with Microsoft Visual Studio (for example, it is used to start
  the Visual Studio Command Prompt). On my machine using the Visual
  Studio Community 2022, the added line is
\begin{cmd}
call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\...
  VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x86
\end{cmd}
  for the 32-bit compiler version (\texttt{x86}) and
\begin{cmd}
call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\...
  VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
\end{cmd}
  for the 64-bit compiler version (\texttt{x64}), where \?...?
  means that the line continues. The line needs
  to be after the \texttt{\@echo~off} command at the beginning of
  the file.
 
  Or, you start the appropriate version of the Visual Studio Command Prompt
  first (look for \emph{x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022},
  \emph{x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022}, or similar),
  and then start the bash shell by hand with
\begin{cmd}
cd C:\Cygwin\bin
bash --login -i
\end{cmd}
  provided that Cygwin is installed in \?C:\Cygwin?.
}

\subsection{Apple Mac OS}

These compilation instructions assume that you use the Gecode binary package for Mac OS (see \autoref{sec:m:started:install:macos}). If you compiled and installed Gecode from the source package, please read \autoref{sec:m:started:linux}.

\paragraph{Commandline.}

When compiling your code using the \?gcc? compiler (invoking it
as \?g++?), the Gecode header files are found automatically, they
are on the default header search path. For linking against the
Gecode framework, just add \?-F/Library/Frameworks? and
\?-framework gecode? as options. Note that only versions 4.2 or
better of \?gcc? are supported.

The following command compiles and links \?send-more-money.cpp? as a
release build (including optimization):
\begin{cmd}
g++ -std=c++11 -F/Library/Frameworks -O3 -c send-more-money.cpp
g++ -std=c++11 -F/Library/Frameworks -framework gecode \
  -o send-more-money send-more-money.cpp
\end{cmd}

\paragraph{XCode.}

You can easily use Gecode within the XCode development
environment by choosing \emph{Add} $\rhd$ \emph{Existing Frameworks\dots} 
from the context menu on your target. Then pick the \?gecode? framework from 
the list. You may have to edit your project settings to choose \emph{Mac~OS~10.6} as the base SDK.

\subsection{Linux and relatives}
\label{sec:m:started:linux}

On Linux (and similar operating systems), Gecode is installed as
a set of shared libraries. The default installation directory is
\?"/usr/local"?, which means that the header files can be found
in \?"/usr/local/include"? and the libraries in
\?"/usr/local/lib"?. Depending on your Linux distribution, a
binary package may have been installed under the \?"/usr"? path
instead. If you installed Gecode from the source package, you may
have chosen a different installation directory. For now, assume
that Gecode is installed in \?"<dir>"?.

\paragraph{Commandline.}

To compile your code using the \?gcc? compiler, you have to add
the option \?-I<dir>/include? so that \?gcc? can find the header
files. Note that only versions 4.2 or better of \?gcc? are supported.

For linking, the path has to be given as \?-L<dir>/lib?, and
in addition the individual Gecode libraries must be linked. You
always have to link against the support and kernel libraries,
using \?-lgecodesupport -lgecodekernel?. For the remaining
libraries, the rule of thumb is that if you include a header file
\CppInline{\litstr{<gecode/FOO.hh>}}, then \?-lgecodeFOO? must be
given as a linker option. For instance, if you use integer
variables and include \CppInline{\litstr{gecode/int.hh}}, you
have to link using \?-lgecodeint?.

Some linkers require the list of libraries to be sorted such that libraries
appear before all libraries they depend on. In this case, use the following
order (and omit libraries you don't use):
\begin{enumerate}
\item \?-lgecodeflatzinc?
\item \?-lgecodedriver?
\item \?-lgecodegist?
\item \?-lgecodesearch?,
\item \?-lgecodeminimodel?
\item \?-lgecodeset?
\item \?-lgecodefloat?
\item \?-lgecodeint?
\item \?-lgecodekernel?
\item \?-lgecodesupport?
\end{enumerate}

A complete example for compiling and linking the file
\?send-more-money.cpp? is as follows.

\begin{cmd}
g++ -I<dir>/include -c send-more-money.cpp
g++ -o send-more-money -L<dir>/lib send-more-money.o \
  -lgecodesearch -lgecodeint -lgecodekernel -lgecodesupport
\end{cmd}
The \?\? at the end of a line means that the line actually
continues on the next line.

In order to run programs that are linked against Gecode, the Gecode libraries must be found on the library path. They either have to be installed in one of the default locations (such as \?/usr/lib?), or the environment variable \?LD_LIBRARY_PATH? has to be set to include \?<dir>/lib?.

\paragraph{Eclipse development environment.}

If you use the \AURL{http://www.eclipse.org/}{Eclipse IDE} with
the \AURL{http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/}{CDT} (C/\CPP\ development
tools), you have to configure the paths to the Gecode header
files and libraries.

In the \emph{Project} menu, select the \emph{Properties} dialog. Under \emph{GCC
\CPP{} Compiler}, add \?<dir>/include? to the \emph{Directories}. Under \emph{GCC
\CPP{} Linker}, add \?<dir>/lib? to the \emph{Library search path}, and the Gecode
libraries you have to link against to the \emph{Libraries} field.

In order to run programs that link against Gecode from within the Eclipse CDT,
select \emph{Open Run Dialog} from the \emph{Run} menu. Either add a new launch
configuration, or modify your existing launch configuration. In the
\emph{Environment} tab, add the environment variable
\?LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<dir>/lib?.

\tip{Eclipse on Windows and Mac OS}{%
  If you use Eclipse on Windows or Mac OS, the procedure should
  be similar, except that you do not have to add the environment
  variable to the launch configuration, and on Windows you do not
  need to specify the libraries to link against.
}


\section{Using Gist}
\label{sec:m:started:gist}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{send more money with gist}
\caption{Using Gist for Send More Money}
\label{fig:m:started:gist}
\end{figure}

When developing a constraint model, the usual outcome of a first
modeling attempt is that the model has no solutions or
searching for a solution takes too much time to be feasible. What one
really needs in these situations is additional insight as to: why
does
the model have no solutions, why is propagation not sufficient, or
why is the branching not appropriate for the problem?

Gecode offers Gist as a graphical and interactive search tool
with which you can explore any part of the search tree of a model
step by step or automatically and inspect the nodes of the search
tree.

Using Gist is absolutely straightforward.
\autoref{fig:m:started:gist} shows how Gist is used for the Send
More Money problem. As before, a space \?m? for the model is
created. This space is passed to Gist, where Gist is instructed
to work in \?dfs? (depth-first search) mode. The call to
\?Gecode::dfs? terminates only after Gist's window is closed.

\caption{Gist screen shots}
\label{fig:m:started:gist:shot}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:m:started:gist:shot} shows two screenshots of Gist.
The left-hand side shows how Gist starts (with no node of the
tree yet explored). The right-hand side shows the fully explored
search tree of Send More Money.

Gist is so intuitive that our recommendation is to just play a
little with it. If you want to know more about Gist,
consult \autoref{chap:m:gist}. 

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{send more money with gist inspection}
\caption{Using Gist for Send More Money with node inspection}
\label{fig:m:started:gist-inspect}
\end{figure}

One additional feature of Gist that comes in handy when
developing constraint models is to inspect nodes of the search
tree by double-clicking them.  \autoref{fig:m:started:gist-inspect}
shows a modified program that instructs Gist to use the \?print()?
function of \?SendMoreMoney?  whenever a node is double-clicked.
Note that the print function has been changed to take a standard
out-stream to print on as argument.

\tip{Gist scales}{%
Do not be afraid to use Gist even on large problems. You can
expect that per Gigabyte of main memory, Gist can maintain around
eight to ten million nodes. And the runtime overhead is low (in our 
experiments, around 15\% compared to the commandline search engine
using one thread). Just be sure to increase the display refresh rate
for larger trees (see \autoref{sec:m:gist:preferences}).
}

\autoref{sec:m:comfy:driver} explains how to use a commandline
driver that supports to execute the same constraint model with
different search engines (for example, \?DFS? or \?Gist?) by
passing options on the commandline.

\tip{Linking against Gist}{%
\label{tip:m:started:link-gist}%
As discussed in \autoref{sec:m:started:run}, when you use Gist on a
platform (Linux and relatives) that requires to state all
libraries to link against, you also have to link against the
library for Gist (that is, for Linux and relatives by adding
\?-lgecodegist? to the compiler options on the commandline).
}

\section{Best solution search}
\label{sec:m:started:search-best}

The last aspect to be discussed in this chapter is how to search
for a best solution. We are using a model for Send Most Money as
an example: find distinct digits for the letters $S$, $E$, $N$,
$D$, $M$, $O$, $T$, and $Y$ such that the well-formed equation
(no leading zeros) $SEND+MOST=MONEY$ holds and that $MONEY$ is
maximal.

\begin{figure}[t]
\insertlitcode{send most money}
\caption{A Gecode model for Send Most Money finding a best solution}
\label{fig:m:started:smm-best}
\end{figure}

Searching for a best solution requires a best solution search
engine and a function that constrains a space to yield a better
solution. A Gecode model for Send Most Money is shown in
\autoref{fig:m:started:smm-best}. The model differs from Send More
Money only by using a different linear equation and the
additional \?constrain()? function.

Assume a new solution, say \?b?, is found during best solution
search: on the current search node \?s? (a space) the member
function \?constrain()? is called and the so-far best solution \?b?
is passed as argument (that is, \?s.constrain(b)? is executed).
The \?constrain()? member function must add a constraint to \?s?
such that \?s? can only yield a better solution than \?b? during
search. For Send Most Money, the \?constrain()? member function is
as follows:
\insertlitcode{send most money:constrain function}

First, the integer value of \?money? in the so-far best solution
is computed from the values of the variables. Note that the
search engine does not know what model it searches a solution
for. The search engine passes a space \?_b? that the \?constrain?
member function must cast into a \?SendMostMoney? space. Then the
constraint is added that a better solution must yield more money.

\paragraph{Using a best solution search engine.}

The main function now uses a branch-and-bound search engine
rather than a plain depth-first engine:
\insertlitcode{send most money:main function}

The loop that iterates over all solutions found by the
branch-and-bound search engine is exactly the same as
before. That means that solutions are found and printed
with an increasing value of $MONEY$. The best solution is printed
last.

The branch-and-bound engine \gecoderef[class]{BAB} (see also
\autoref{sec:m:search:simple}) calls the \?constrain()? member
function defined by the model. Note that every space defines a
default \?constrain()? member function (to keep the design of
models simple). If a model does not re-define the \?constrain()?
member function (either directly or indirectly bu inheriting a
\?constrain()? function), the default function will do nothing.

Using Gist for best solution search is straightforward. Instead
of using \?Gist::dfs?, one uses \?Gist::bab? to put Gist into
branch-and-bound mode.

In \autoref{sec:m:comfy:cost} it is discussed how a simple \?cost()?
function can be used for best solution search instead of a more
general \?constrain()? function. 

\section{Obtaining Gecode}
\label{sec:m:started:obtain}

This section explains how to obtain Gecode. There are two basic
options: install Gecode as a binary package (explained in
\autoref{sec:m:started:install}) or compile Gecode from its
source (explained in \autoref{sec:m:started:compile} and
\autoref{sec:m:started:compileadvanced}).

We recommend to use the pre-compiled binaries we provide, unless
you like to tinker. The advantage of the packages we provide is
that required and additional software for those platforms not
having automatic package management (for example, Microsoft
Windows) and reference documentation in platform-specific format
are already included.

\subsection{Installing Gecode}
\label{sec:m:started:install}

Naturally the following sections are platform specific.

\subsubsection{Installing Gecode on Windows}
\label{sec:m:started:install:windows}

The pre-compiled Gecode binaries available for download require
Microsoft Visual Studio. Note that Visual Studio Community
is available free of charge from
\AURL{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/}{Microsoft}.

Pre-compiled binaries are available for several versions of
Microsoft Visual \CPP. The binary packages include everything
needed (in particular, Qt for Gist).

\subsubsection{Installing Gecode on Apple Mac OS}
\label{sec:m:started:install:macos}

The pre-compiled Gecode binaries for Mac OS require the XCode
developer tools, version 3.1 or higher. XCode is available from
the Mac OS install DVD, or from the
\AURL{http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action}{Apple
  Mac Dev Center}.

The binary packages include the Qt library (necessary for Gist).

After installing these prerequisites, simply download and open
the Gecode disk image for Mac OS, double-click the installer
package, and follow the instructions.

\subsubsection{Installing Gecode on Linux and relatives}

The Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions come with pre-compiled
packages for Gecode. These packages (and all the packages they
depend on) can be installed with the usual package management
tools (for example, \texttt{apt-get}). Note that we do not maintain these
packages, and that the repositories do not always provide the
most up-to-date version.

If the Linux distribution of your choice does not provide a
binary package for Gecode, or does not contain the latest
version, please refer to the next section for instructions how to
compile Gecode from the source.


\subsection{Compiling Gecode}
\label{sec:m:started:compile}

Gecode can be built on all recent versions of Windows, Linux, and
MacOS X. Porting to other Unix flavors should be easy, if any
change is necessary at all. The Gecode source code is available
from the \AURL{https://www.gecode.org/download.html}{download
  section} of the Gecode web site.

\paragraph{Prerequisites.}

In order to compile Gecode, you need a standard Unix toolchain
including the following programs: a bash-compatible shell, GNU
make, sed, cp, diff, tar, perl, grep.

These are available in all standard installations of Linux. On
MacOS X, you need to install the XCode developer tools, version
3.1 or higher. XCode is available from the Mac OS install DVD, or
from the
\AURL{http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action}{Apple
  Mac Dev Center}. For Windows, we require the
\AURL{http://www.cygwin.com/}{Cygwin environment} that provides
all necessary tools (see also \autoref{tip:m:started:cygwin}).

We currently support:
\begin{itemize}
\item Microsoft Visual \CPP{} compilers for Windows. Microsoft
  Visual Studio Community is available free of charge
  from \AURL{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/}{Microsoft}.
\item GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) for Unix flavors
  such as Linux and MacOS X. The GNU gcc is open source software
  and available from \AURL{http://gcc.gnu.org/}{the GCC home
    page}. It is included in all Linux distributions and the
  Apple MacOS X developer tools.  

  \textbf{Important:} Gecode requires at least
  version 4.2 of \texttt{gcc}.
\item Intel \CPP{} compiler, although we do not test the binaries
  produced by it.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Configuring the sources.}

After unpacking the sources, you need to run the \?configure?
script in the toplevel directory. This script (which uses GNU
autoconf) acquires information about the system you try to
compile Gecode on.

To setup Gecode for your particular system, you may need to add
one or more of the following options to \?configure?:

\begin{itemize}
\item To install Gecode somewhere else than the default
   \?/usr/local?, please use the commandline \?--prefix=[...]? switch.
\item You can enable and disable the individual modules Gecode consists of
   by using \?--enable-[MODULE]? and \?--disable-[MODULE]?.
\end{itemize}

You can get a list of all supported configuration options by
calling \?configure? with the \?--help? switch.
\autoref{sec:m:started:compileadvanced} explains the
configuration options in more detail, if the defaults do not work
for you.

\paragraph{Compiling the sources.}

After successful configuration, simply invoking
\begin{cmd}
make
\end{cmd}
in the toplevel Gecode directory will compile the whole library
and the examples.

\paragraph{Installation.}

After a successful compilation, you can install the Gecode library
and all header files necessary for compiling against it by invoking
\begin{cmd}
make install
\end{cmd}
in the build directory.

\tip{Do not forget the library path}{
\label{tip:m:started:install:ld}%
In order to run programs that are linked against Gecode (such as
the Gecode examples), the libraries must be found on the library
path. See \autoref{sec:m:started:linux} for details.
}


\paragraph{Running the examples.}

After compiling the examples, they can be run directly from the command
line. For instance, try the Golomb Rulers Problem:

\begin{cmd}
./examples/golomb
\end{cmd}
or (when running Windows):
\begin{cmd}
./examples/golomb.exe
\end{cmd}

On some platforms, you may need to set environment variables like
\?LD_LIBRARY_PATH? (Linux) or \?DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH?  (Mac OS) to
the toplevel compile directory or the installation directory
(where the dynamic libraries are placed after compilation).

\paragraph{Compilation with Gist.}

The Gecode Interactive Search Tool (Gist) is a graphical search
engine for Gecode, built on top of the
\AURL{http://qt.nokia.com/}{Qt GUI toolkit}.

In order to compile Gecode with Gist, you need an installation of
the Qt library including the development header files. The Qt
binary packages for Windows and Mac OS (available from
\AURL{http://qt.nokia.com/}{the Nokia Qt web pages}) as well as
the Qt packages in the usual Linux distributions contain
everything that is necessary. You can however also compile Qt
from its sources, \AURL{http://qt.nokia.com/}{available from
  Nokia under both free and commercial licenses}.

\textbf{Please note that if you develop closed-source software with Gecode and Gist, you will have to either comply with the LGPL, or obtain a commercial license for Qt from Nokia!}

If you are developing on Windows using the Microsoft Visual \CPP{} compiler,
make sure to compile the Qt library with the same compiler.

After installing Qt, make sure that the \?qmake? tool is in your
shell path. The Gecode \?configure? script will then detect the
presence of Qt and automatically compile with support for Gist.

\tip{Compatible compilers and installations for Gecode and Qt}{
\label{tip:m:started:samecompiler}%
Please make sure that the compiler with which Qt has been
compiled is compatible with the compiler you intend to use for
Gecode (most likely, the requirement is that both packages must
be compiled with the very same compiler).

In particular, make sure that this is true when you install a Qt
binary package. Watch out for pre-installed Qt packages! For
example: the Qt packages on Windows available through Cygwin
should be disabled or deinstalled when you want to use Qt and
Gecode with the Microsoft Visual \CPP{} compiler.
}

\paragraph{Compilation with support for trigonometric and
  transcendental float constraints.}
\label{par:m:started:mpfr}

By default, trigonometric and transcendental float constraints are
\emph{disabled} (see also \autoref{m:float:mpfr}). To enable
them, Gecode must be configured to use the
\AURL{http://gmplib.org/}{GMP} (or
\AURL{http://www.mpir.org/}{MPIR} instead) and
\AURL{http://www.mpfr.org/}{MPFR} libraries. After having
installed the libraries, the following commandline options
instruct \?configure? to use these packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item \?-with-gmp-include=...?: the directory where the header
  files of GMP or MPIR are installed.
\item \?-with-gmp-lib=...?: the directory where the library
  files of GMP or MPIR are installed.
\item \?-with-mpfr-include=...?: the directory where the header
  files of MPFR are installed.
\item \?-with-mpfr-lib=...?: the directory where the library
  files of MPFR are installed.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Advanced configuration and compilation}
\label{sec:m:started:compileadvanced}

If the instructions from the previous section do not work for
your system, please have a look at the following example
configurations and advanced options to configure Gecode to your
needs.


\subsubsection{Example configurations}

To compile only the Gecode library \textbf{without examples} on a Unix machine, use

\begin{cmd}
./configure --disable-examples
\end{cmd}

\noindent To compile on a \textbf{Unix machine} using a different than the default
\?gcc? compiler, and install under \?/opt/gecode?, use

\begin{cmd}
./configure --prefix=/opt/gecode CC=gcc-4.2 CXX=g++-4.2
\end{cmd}

\noindent To compile a \textbf{debug build} on Unix, turning on all assertions and not
inlining anything, use

\begin{cmd}
./configure --enable-debug
\end{cmd}

\noindent To compile on a system using a different than the default compiler,
and a \?/bin/sh? that is not bash compatible (for example, on a
\textbf{Solaris machine}), use

\begin{cmd}
./configure --with-host-os=linux \
      CC="gcc-4.2" CXX="g++-4.2" \
      SHELL="/bin/bash"
make SHELL="/bin/bash"
\end{cmd}

\noindent You can compile as \textbf{universal binary} on a Mac OS
machine. Configure with

\begin{cmd}
./configure --with-architectures=i386,ppc
\end{cmd}

\noindent For building universal binaries on a PowerPC machine, you have to supply the path to the universal SDK (which is the default on Intel based Macs):

\begin{cmd}
./configure --with-architectures=i386,ppc \
      --with-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
\end{cmd}

\paragraph{Disabling the default memory allocator.}
\label{par:s:started:allocator}

By default, Gecode uses a default memory allocator based on the C
standard library functions \?malloc()? and \?free()?. This
default allocator can be disabled by

\begin{cmd}
./configure --disable-allocator
\end{cmd}

If the default allocator is disabled, one must supply the
implementation of an allocator, this is explained in 
\autoref{par:p:memory:allocator}.


\paragraph{Passing options for compilation.}

Additional options for compilation can be passed to the compiler
from the make commandline via the variable \?CXXUSR?. For
example, to pass to \?gcc? the additional option \?-mtune=i686? the following
can be used:

\begin{cmd}
make CXXUSR="-mtune=i686"
\end{cmd}

\paragraph{Compiling in a separate directory.}

The Gecode library can be built in a separate directory. This is useful
if you do not want to clutter the source tree with all the object files
and libraries.

Configuring Gecode in a separate directory is easy. Assume that the
sources can be found in directory \?$GSOURCEDIR?, change to
the directory where you want to compile Gecode and call

\begin{cmd}
$GSOURCEDIR/configure [options]
\end{cmd}
This will generate all necessary files in the new build directory.

\paragraph{Dependency management.}

The dependencies between source files are not handled automatically. If you
are using a Gecode version from our subversion repository or if you
modified any of the source files, you will have to call
\?make depend? before compilation in order to determine the
source dependencies.

Dependency management is only needed for recompiling Gecode after changing
something. In an unmodified version (or after a \?make clean?)
all files are compiled anyway.

\paragraph{Compiling for unsupported platforms.}

If you want to try compiling Gecode on a platform that we do not
mention, you can override the platform tests during
\?configure?. There are two options to specify the type of
platform:

\begin{itemize}
\item \?--with-host-os=[linux|darwin|windows]?
\item \?--with-compiler-vendor=[gnu|microsoft]?
\end{itemize}

Using the first option, you can state that your platform should behave like
Linux, Darwin (which is actually BSD), or Windows. This affects mainly
the filenames and the tools used to generate shared and static libraries.

The second option says
that your compiler can be used very much like the gnu compiler
\?gcc?, or the Microsoft compiler \?cl?.
Please let us know of any successful attempt at
compiling Gecode on other platforms.

\subsubsection{Useful Makefile targets}

The main Gecode Makefile supports the following useful targets:

\begin{itemize}
\item \?all? compiles all parts of the library that were enabled
                    during \?configure?, and the examples if
                    enabled.
\item \?install? installs library, headers and examples (if enabled)
                        into the \?prefix? given at
                        \?configure?.
\item \?clean? removes object files.
\item \?veryclean? removes object files, libraries, and all files 
                          generated during \?make?.
\item \?distclean? removes object files, libraries, and all
                          generated files.
\item \?depend? generates dependencies between source files.
\item \?test? compiles the test suite.
\item \?doc? generates the reference documentation using doxygen.
\item \?installdoc? installs the documentation.
\item \?distdoc? creates tgz and zip archives of the documentation.
\end{itemize}

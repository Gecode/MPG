\chapter{Getting comfortable}
\label{chap:m:comfy}

This chapter provides an overview of some functionality in Gecode
that makes modeling and execution of models more convenient. 

\paragraph{Overview.}

Expressions constructed from standard arithmetic operators for
posting linear constraints are discussed in
\autoref{sec:m:comfy:expr}, cost functions for best solution
search are discussed in \autoref{sec:m:comfy:cost}, and a script
commandline driver that supports the most common options for
running models from the commandline is discussed in
\autoref{sec:m:comfy:driver}.


\section{Posting linear constraints de-mystified}
\label{sec:m:comfy:expr}

\begin{figure}[p]
\insertlitcode{send more money de-mystified}
\caption{A Gecode model for Send More Money using modeling support}
\label{fig:m:comfy:smm-mm}
\end{figure}

As mentioned in the previous chapter, Gecode comes with simple
modeling support for posting constraints defined by linear
expressions and relations.  The parts of the program for Send
More Money from \autoref{fig:m:started:smm} that change are shown
in \autoref{fig:m:comfy:smm-mm}. In order to use the modeling
support, we have to include the MiniModel header.

The MiniModel module also supports Boolean expressions and
relations, and much more, see \autoref{chap:m:minimodel} for more
information. The module in itself does not implement any
constraints. The function \?rel? takes the description of the
linear constraint, analyzes it, and posts a linear constraint by
using the same \?linear?  function we have been using in
\autoref{sec:m:started:first}.



\section{Using a cost function}
\label{sec:m:comfy:cost}

\begin{figure}[p]
\insertlitcode{send most money with cost}
\caption{A Gecode model for Send Most Money using a cost function}
\label{fig:m:comfy:smm-best:minimodel}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:m:comfy:smm-best:minimodel} uses the class
\?MaximizeSpace? for cost-based optimization for Send
Most Money. The class \?MaximizeSpace?  is also
included in Gecode's MiniModel module (see
\autoref{sec:m:minimodel:optimize} and
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelMiniModelOptimize}).

The \?MaximizeSpace? class is a sub-class of \?Space? that
defines a \?constrain()? member function based on the cost of a
space. Our model must implement a virtual \?cost()? function that
returns a variable defining the cost (the function must be
\?const?). In our example, we extend the model to maintain the
cost (the amount of money) in a dedicated variable \?money? (note
that this variable must also be updated during cloning).

\begin{samepage}
The cost function then just returns the amount of money as
follows:
\insertlitcode{send most money with cost:cost function}
\end{samepage}


\section{Using the script commandline driver}
\label{sec:m:comfy:driver}

In order to experiment from the commandline with different model
variants, different search engines, and so on, it is convenient
to have support for passing different option values on the
commandline that then can be used by a model. Gecode comes with a
simple commandline driver that defines \?Script? as a subclass of
\?Space? for modeling and support for commandline
options.\footnote{One might wonder why a commandline driver should
  be part of Gecode but this is due to popular demand. The driver
  functionality has been there for the examples that ship with
  Gecode and everybody has been using it and got into trouble as
  it was not available as a module that could be easily reused.
  Here we are!}

\paragraph{Defining a script class.}

Suppose that we want to experiment with two different variants of
Send Most Money with a cost function: the first variant uses the
model from \autoref{sec:m:comfy:cost} and the second variant models
the equation $SEND+MOST=MONEY$ by using carry variables.

\begin{samepage}
Using carry variables with several linear equations instead of a
single linear equation is straightforward. A carry
variable is an integer variable with value \?0? or \?1? and each
column in the equation $SEND+MOST=MONEY$ is modeled by a linear
equation involving the appropriate carry variable as follows:
\insertlitcode{send most money with driver:using carries}
\end{samepage}


\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{send most money with driver}
\caption{A Gecode model for Send Most Money using the script
  commandline driver}
\label{fig:m:comfy:driver}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:m:comfy:driver} shows a model for Send Most Money that
uses the \?MaximizeScript? class as base class (see
\gecoderef[group]{TaskDriverScript}) rather than \?MaximizeSpace?
(likewise, the driver module also offers a \?Script? class to be
used instead of \?Space?). There are two main differences between
\?MaximizeScript? and \?MaximizeSpace? (\?Script? and \?Space?).
First, the constructor must accept a constant argument of type
\?Options?  (actually, it must accept a constant argument of the
type that is specified for the \?run? member function to be
explained below) that is used to pass values computed from options
passed on the commandline. Second, a subclass of \?MaximizeSpace?
must define a virtual print function that accepts a standard
output stream as argument.

Note that one has to include
\CppInline{\litstr{<gecode/driver.hh>}} for a model that uses the
script commandline driver. However, neither
\CppInline{\litstr{<gecode/search.hh>}} nor
\CppInline{\litstr{<gecode/gist.hh>}} need to be included as search is
handled by the commandline driver.

\tip{Linking against the driver}{%
\label{tip:m:comfy:link-driver}%
As discussed in \autoref{sec:m:started:run}, when you use the
commandline driver on a
platform (Linux and relatives) that requires to state all
libraries to link against, you also have to link against the
library for the commandline driver (that is, for Linux and relatives by adding
\?-lgecodedriver? to the compiler options on the commandline).
}

The class \?SendMostMoney? defines an enumeration type with
values \?MODEL_SINGLE? (for a model where a single linear
equation is posted for $SEND+MOST=MONEY$) and \?MODEL_CARRY?
(for a model where several linear equations using carry variables
are posted for $SEND+MOST=MONEY$). The options object \?opt?  provides a
member function \?model? that returns an enumeration
value and posts the constraints accordingly.

\paragraph{Defining commandline options.}

The mapping between strings passed on the commandline and the
values \?MODEL_SINGLE? and \?MODEL_CARRY? is established by
configuring an object of class \gecoderef[class]{Options}
accordingly as follows:
\insertlitcode{send most money with driver:commandline options}

This code creates a new \?Option? object \?opt? where the string
\?"SEND + MOST = MONEY"? serves as identification (such as when
requesting to print help about the available commandline
options). 

The first call to \?opt.model()? defines that \texttt{single} is a
legal value for the option switch \texttt{-model}, that the
string \texttt{use single linear equation} is the help text for
the option value, and that the corresponding value (that is, the
value returned by \?opt.model()?) is
\?SendMostMoney::MODEL_SINGLE?. The last call to \?opt.model?
defines the default value.

As we are performing best solution search, we want to compute
all possible solutions. This is done by setting \?opt.solutions?
to \?0? (the default value is \?1? for searching for the first
solution). Note that this default value can be changed on the
commandline by passing an integer as value for the
\texttt{-solutions} commandline option.  Parsing the commandline
by \?parse?  now takes the configured values for the commandline
options \texttt{-model} and \texttt{-solutions} into account.


The \gecoderef[class]{Options} class supports most options that
are useful for propagation, search, and so on similar to the
\texttt{model} option. The full details are explained in
\autoref{chap:m:driver}.

The last piece of our model is calling the static \?run? method of the
script class by passing as template arguments our script class
type \?SendMostMoney?, \?BAB? as the search engine we would like
to use, and the type of options \?Options? (as mentioned before,
the constructor of the script must accept a single argument of
this type).
\insertlitcode{send most money with driver:run script}


\paragraph{Running the script from the commandline.}

Suppose that we have compiled our script example as the file
\?send-most-money-with-driver.exe? (for some platforms, just drop
\?.exe?). Then
\begin{cmd}
send-most-money-with-driver.exe
\end{cmd}
prints something along the lines
\begin{cmd}
SEND + MOST = MONEY
{9, 3, 4, 2, 1, 0, 5, 7}
{9, 3, 4, 2, 1, 0, 6, 8}
{9, 4, 5, 2, 1, 0, 6, 8}
{9, 5, 6, 3, 1, 0, 4, 7}
{9, 6, 7, 2, 1, 0, 3, 5}
{9, 6, 7, 3, 1, 0, 5, 8}
{9, 7, 8, 2, 1, 0, 3, 5}
{9, 7, 8, 2, 1, 0, 4, 6}

Initial
        propagators: 3
        branchers:   1

Summary
        runtime:      0.024 (24.000000 ms)
        solutions:    8
        propagations: 109
        nodes:        33
        failures:     9
        peak depth:   8
        peak memory:  14 KB
\end{cmd}

If we want to try the model with carry variables we can do that
by running
\begin{cmd}
send-most-money-with-driver.exe -model carry
\end{cmd}

We can also use Gist by giving a different mode of
execution:
\begin{cmd}
send-most-money-with-driver.exe -mode gist
\end{cmd}
As we call \?run? with \?BAB? as type of search, Gist will
automatically start in branch-and-bound mode. Other supported
modes are \?solution? (the default mode shown above), \?time? for
printing average runtimes, and \?stat? for just printing an
execution statistics but no solutions.


Another important commandline option is \?-help? which prints the
options supported by the script together with some configuration
information. The full details are explained
in \autoref{chap:m:driver}.

\tip{Aborting execution}{%
In the \?solution? and \?stat? modes, the driver aborts the search gracefully
if you send it a \?SIGINT? signal, for example by pressing Ctrl-C on the command
line. So if your model runs a long time without returning solutions, you can
press Ctrl-C and still see the statistics that tell you how deep the search
tree was up to that point, or how many nodes the search has explored.

When you press Ctrl-C twice, the process is interrupted immediately. This can be useful when debugging programs, e.g.\ if the process is stuck in an infinite loop. Alternatively, you can make the driver ignore Ctrl-C altogether, so that it immediately interrupts your program, using the command line option \texttt{-interrupt false}.
}

\tip{How Gecode has been configured}{%
\label{tip:m:comfy:conf}
Depending on the hardware and software platform on which Gecode has been
compiled, some features (such as Gist or thread support for
parallel search) might not be available. 
For example, if Gist is not supported, the request for 
\?-mode gist? 
will be silently ignored and the normal mode 
(\?-mode solution?) is used instead.

To find out which features are available, just invoke a program
using the commandline driver with the \?-help? option. At the
beginning of the printed text, you will find a short
configuration summary.

Note that all features are enabled for the precompiled binaries
that are available from the Gecode webpages.
}

\tip{Which version of Gecode are we using?}{
Some programs might have to deal with incompatible changes
between different versions of Gecode. The macro
\?GECODE_VERSION_NUMBER? can be used to find out which
version of Gecode is used during compilation. The macro's
value is defined as $100000\times x + 100\times y +z$ for Gecode
version $x.y.z$.

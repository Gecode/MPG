\chapter{Getting started}
\label{chap:b:started}

This chapters presents how to program branchers as
implementations of branchings.

\begin{important}
  You need to read about search and programming propagators
  before reading this chapter. For search, you need to read
  \autoref{chap:m:search} first, in particular
  \autoref{sec:m:search:re}. For programming propagators, the
  initial \autoref{chap:p:started} is sufficient.
\end{important}

\paragraph{Overview.}

\mbox{}\autoref{sec:b:started:overview} sets the stage for
programming branchers by explaining how search engines, spaces,
and branchers together implement the branching process during
search. A simple brancher is used as an initial example in
\autoref{sec:b:started:nonemin}. A brancher that chooses its
views for branching according to some criterion is demonstrated in
\autoref{sec:b:started:sizemin}.  \autoref{sec:b:started:assign}
presents a specialized brancher for assigning views rather than
branching on them. Variable views for branchers are discussed in
\autoref{sec:b:started:views}.


\section{What to implement?}
\label{sec:b:started:overview}

A \emph{branching} is used in modeling for describing the shape
of the search tree. A \emph{brancher} implements a branching.
That is, a branching is similar to a constraint, whereas a
brancher is similar to a propagator. Branchings take 
variables as arguments and branchers compute with variable views.

\paragraph{Brancher order.}

Creating a brancher registers it with its home space. A space
maintains a queue of its branchers in that the brancher that is
registered first is also used first for branching. The first
brancher in the queue of branchers is referred to as the
\emph{current brancher}.

\paragraph{Executing branchers.}

A brancher in Gecode is implemented as a subclass of the class
\gecoderef[class]{Brancher}. Similar to a propagator, a brancher must
implement several virtual member functions defining the brancher's
behavior.

The most important functions of a brancher can be sketched as
follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \?status()? function tests whether the current brancher
  has anything left to do.
\item The \?choice()? function creates a \emph{choice} that
  describes the next alternatives for search. The choice must be
  independent of the brancher's home space, and must contain all
  necessary information for the alternatives.
\item The \?commit()? function takes a previously created choice
  and commits to one of the choice's alternatives. Note that
  \?commit()? must use only the information in the choice, the
  domains of the brancher's views might be weaker, stronger, or
  incomparable to the domains when the choice was created (due to
  recomputation, see \autoref{sec:s:re:compatible}).
\end{itemize}

Branchers and propagators are both actors, they both inherit from
the class \gecoderef[class]{Actor}. That entails that copying and
disposal of branchers is the same as it is for propagators and
hence does not require any further discussion (see
\autoref{sec:p:started:overview}). Also memory management is
identical, see \autoref{chap:p:memory}.

How branchers execute is best understood when studying the
operations that are performed by a search engine on a space. 

\paragraph{Status computation.}

A search engine calls the \?status()? function of a space to
determine whether a space is failed, solved, or must be branched
on. When the \?status()? function of a space is executed,
constraint propagation is performed as described in
\autoref{sec:p:started:solving}.  If the space is failed,
\?status()? returns the value \?SS_FAILED? (a value of type
\?SpaceStatus?, see \gecoderef[group]{TaskSearch}).

Assume that constraint propagation has finished (hence, the space
is stable) and the space is not failed. Then, \?status()?
computes the status of the current brancher.  The status of a
brancher is computed by the virtual \?status()?  member function
a brancher implements. If the brancher's \?status()? function
returns \?false?, the space's \?status()?  function tries to select
the next brancher in the queue of branchers as the current
brancher. If there are no branchers left in the queue of
branchers, the space's \?status()? function terminates and reports
that the space is solved (by returning \?SS_SOLVED?).  Otherwise
the process is repeated until the space has a current brancher
such that its \?status()? function has returned \?true?.  In this
case, the space's \?status()? function returns \?SS_BRANCH?  to
signal to the search engine that the space requires branching.

The \?status()? function of a brancher does not do anything to
actually perform branching, it just checks whether there is
something left to do for the brancher (for example, whether there
are unassigned views left in an array of views to be branched
on).

\paragraph{Choice creation.}

In case the space's \?status()? function has returned \?SS_BRANCH?,
the search engine typically branches. In order to actually
branch, the search engine must know how to branch. To keep search
engines orthogonal to the space type they compute with (that is, the problem a
search engine tries to find solutions for), a
search engine can request a \emph{choice} as a description of how
to branch. With a choice, a search engine can \emph{commit} a
space to a particular alternative as defined by the choice.
Alternatives are numbered from zero to the number of alternatives
minus one, where the number of alternatives is defined by the
choice. A choice is specific to a brancher and must provide
sufficient information such that the brancher together with the
choice can commit to all possible alternatives.

A search engine requests the computation of a choice by executing
the \?choice()? function of a space. The space's \?choice()?
function does nothing but returning the choice created by the
\?choice()? function of the current brancher. Let us postpone the
discussion of how a choice can store the information needed for
branching. A choice always provides two important pieces of
information:
\begin{itemize}
\item The number of its alternatives (an unsigned integer greater
  than zero) is available through the function \?alternatives()?.
\item A unique identity inherited from the brancher that has
  created the choice. This information is not available to a
  programmer but makes it possible for a space to find the
  corresponding brancher for a given choice (to be detailed
  below).
\end{itemize}

A search engine must execute the \?choice()? function of a space
\emph{immediately} after executing the space's \?status()?
function. Any other action on the space (such as adding
propagators or modifying views) might change the current brancher
of the space and hence \?choice()? might fail to compute the correct
choice.

\paragraph{Committing to alternatives.}

Assume that the engine has a choice \?ch? with two alternatives
and that the engine has created a clone \?c? of the current space
\?s? by\footnote{Note that search engines compute with pointers
  to spaces and choices rather than references, hence \?s?, \?c?,
  and \?ch? are
  pointers.}
\begin{code}
Space* c = s->clone();
\end{code}

The search engine typically commits \?s? to the first
alternative (the alternative with number~\?0?) as defined by the
space and later it might commit \?c? to the second alternative
(the alternative with number~\?1?). Let us first consider
committing the space \?s? to the first alternative by:
\begin{code}
s->commit(*ch,0);
\end{code}
The space's \?commit()? function attempts to find a brancher that
corresponds to the choice \?ch? (based on the identity that is
stored by the choice). Assume, the space's \?commit()? function
finds a brancher \?b?. Then it invokes the \?commit()? function
of the brancher \?b? as follows:
\begin{code}
b.commit(*s,*ch,0);
\end{code}
Now the brancher \?b? executes its \?commit()? function. The
function typically modifies a view as defined by the
choice (\?*ch? in our example) and the number of the alternative
(\?0? in our example) passed as arguments. The
brancher's \?commit()? function must return an executions status
that captures whether the operations performed by \?commit()?
have failed (\?ES_FAILED? is returned) or not (\?ES_OK? is
returned).

If the space's \?commit()? function does not find a brancher that
corresponds to the choice \?ch?, an exception of type
\gecoderef[class]{SpaceNoBrancher} is thrown. The reason for
being unable to find a corresponding brancher is that the
search engine is implemented incorrectly (see \autoref{part:s}).

\begin{samepage}
At some later time, the search engine might decide to explore the
second alternative of the choice \?ch? by using the clone \?c?:
\begin{code}
c->commit(*ch,1);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
Then, the \?commit()? function of the space \?c? tries to find
the brancher corresponding to \?ch?. This of course will be a
different brancher in a different space: however, the brancher
found will be a copy of the brancher \?b?.

\paragraph{More on choices.}

A consequence of the discussion of \?commit()? is that choices
cannot store information that belongs to a particular space: the
very idea of a choice is that it can be used with different
spaces (above: original and clone)! That also entails that a
choice is allocated independently from any space and must be
deleted explicitly by a search engine.

Consider as an example a brancher that wants to create the choice
$(\mathtt{x}_i = \mathtt n)\vee(\mathtt{x}_i \neq \mathtt n)$
where \?x? is an array of integer views (that is, $\mathtt{x}_i =
\mathtt n$ is alternative~\?0? and $\mathtt{x}_i \neq \mathtt n$
is alternative~\?1?). The choice is not allowed to store
$\mathtt{x}_i$ directly (as $\mathtt{x}_i$ belongs to a space),
instead it stores the position $i$ in the array \?x? and the
integer value \?n?.  When the brancher's \?commit()? function is
executed, the brancher provides the view array \?x? (the part
that is specific to a space) and the choice provides the position
$i$ and the value \?n? (the parts that are space-independent).

A choice must inherit from the class \gecoderef[class]{Choice}
and needs to implement a single virtual member function \?size()?
which returns the size (of type \?size_t?) of the choice. This
function can be used by a search engine to compute the amount of
memory allocated by a choice (this can be useful for statistics).

\paragraph{Even more on (archives of) choices.}

Branchers and choices must support one more operation, the
\emph{(un-)archiving} of choices. Archiving enables choices to be used not
only in the same search engine with a different space, but transferred to a
search engine in a different process, possibly on a different computer. The
main application for this are distributed search engines.

An \gecoderef[class]{Archive} is simply an array of unsigned
integers, which is easy to transmit e.g. over a network. Every
choice must implement a virtual \?archive()? member function,
which in turn calls \?archive()? on the super class and then
writes the contents of the choice into the archive. Conversely,
branchers must implement a virtual \?choice()? member function
that gets an archive as the argument and returns a new choice.

\paragraph{Brancher invariants and life cycle.}

The very idea of a choice is that it is a space-independent
description of how to perform commits on a space. Consider the
following example scenario: a search engine has a space \?s? and
a clone \?c? of \?s?. Then, the search engine explores part of
the search tree starting from \?s? and stores a sequence of
choices while exploring. Then, the engine wants to recompute a
node in the search tree and uses the clone \?c? for it: it can
recompute by performing commits with the choices it has
stored. 

In this scenario, the brancher to which the choices correspond
\emph{must} be able to perform the commits as described by the
choices. That in particular entails that a brancher cannot modify
its state arbitrarily: it must always guarantee that choices
it created earlier (actually, that a copy of it created earlier)
can be interpreted correctly.

The \?status()? and \?choice()? functions of a brancher
can be seen as being orthogonal to its \?commit()? function. The former
functions compute new choices. The latter function must be
capable to commit according to other choices that are unrelated
to the choice that might be computed by the \?choice()? function.
Even if the \?status()? function of a brancher has
already returned \?false?, the brancher must still be capable of
performing commits.  Hence, a brancher cannot be disposed
immediately when its \?status()? returns
\?false?.

Spaces impose an important invariant on the use of its
\?commit()? and \?choice()? function. After having executed the
\?choice()?  function, no calls to \?commit()? are allowed with
choices created earlier (that is, \?choice()? invalidates all
previously created choices for \?commit()?). That also clarifies
when branchers are disposed: the \?choice()? function of a space
disposes all branchers for which their \?status()? functions have
returned \?false? before. This invariant is essential for
recomputation, see \autoref{sec:s:re:compatible}.

\paragraph{Garbage collection of branchers.}
\label{par:b:started:gc}

As the \?choice()? function of a space performs garbage
collection of branchers, it can also
be called in case the space's \?status()? function returned
\?SS_SOLVED?  (signaling that no more branchers are left). In
this case, the branchers are garbage collected but no choice is
returned (instead, \?NULL? is returned). See
\autoref{sec:s:started:dfsbin} for an example and
\autoref{sec:s:started:space} for a discussion.

\section{Implementing a \?nonemin? branching}
\label{sec:b:started:nonemin}

This section presents an example for a branching and its
implementing brancher.

The branching
\begin{code}
void nonemin(Home home, const IntVarArgs& x);
\end{code}
branches by selecting the first unassigned variable
$\mathtt{x}_i$ in \?x?  and tries to assign $\mathtt{x}_i$ to the
smallest possible value of $\mathtt{x}_i$.

That is, \?nonemin? is equivalent to the predefined branching
(see \autoref{sec:m:branch:int}) used as
\begin{code}
branch(home, x, INT_VAR_NONE(), INT_VAL_MIN());
\end{code}

For examples of problem-specific branchers see
\autoref{chap:c:knights} and \autoref{chap:c:bpp}.

\subsection{A naive brancher}
\label{sec:b:started:nonemin:naive}


\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{none min}
\caption{A branching and brancher for \?nonemin?}
\label{fig:b:started:nonemin}
\end{figure}

\mbox{}\autoref{fig:b:started:nonemin} shows the class \?NoneMin?
implementing the brancher for the branching \?nonemin?.
\?NoneMin? inherits from the class \gecoderef[class]{Brancher}.
The branching post function creates a view array and posts a
brancher of class \?NoneMin?. The brancher post function does not
return an execution status as posting a brancher does not fail
(in contrast to a propagator post function, see
\autoref{par:p:started:post}). The constructor as well as the
brancher post function of \?NoneMin? are exactly as to be
expected from our knowledge on implementing propagators (of
course, branchers do not use subscriptions).

\paragraph{Status computation.}

The status computation of a \?NoneMin? brancher is
straightforward. The \?status()? function scans all views in the
view array \?x? and returns \?true? if there is an unassigned
view left: 
\insertlitcode{none min:status}

\paragraph{Choice computation.}

Computing the choice for a brancher involves two aspects: the definition
of the class for the choice object and the \?choice()? member
function of a brancher that creates choice objects.

The choice object \?PosVal? inherits from the class
\gecoderef[class]{Choice}. The information that is required for
committing is which view and which value should be used.
As discussed above, the \?PosVal? choice does not store
the view directly, but the position \?pos? of the view in the
view array \?x?. A \?PosVal? choice stores both position and
value as integers as follows:
\insertlitcode{none min:choice definition}

The constructor of \?PosVal? uses the constructor of \?Choice? for
initialization, where both the brancher \?b? and the number of
alternatives of the choice (\?2? for \?PosVal?) are passed as
arguments. The \?size()? function just returns the size of a
\?PosVal? object. The \?archive()? function calls \?Choice::archive()? and then writes the position and value to the archive.

The \?choice(Space& home)? member function of the brancher is called directly (by the
\?choice(Space& home)? function of a space) after the \?status()?
function of the brancher in case the \?status()? of the brancher
has returned \?true?. That is, the brancher is the current
brancher of the space and still needs to create choices for
branching. For a \?NoneMin? brancher that means that there is
definitely a not yet assigned view in the view array \?x?, and
that the brancher must choose the first unassigned view:
\insertlitcode{none min:choice}

The \?choice(Space& home)? function returns a new \?PosVal? object for
position \?i? and the smallest value of \?x[i]?. The
\?choice(const Space&, Archive& e)? function creates a choice from the information contained 
in the archive.

\tip{Never execute}{ 
\label{tip:b:started:never}%
The macro \?GECODE_NEVER? states that it
  will never be executed. If compiled in debug mode,
  \?GECODE_NEVER? corresponds to the assertion \?assert(false)?.
  If compiled in release mode, the macro informs the compiler
  (depending on the platform) that \?GECODE_NEVER? is never
  executed so that the compiler can take advantage of this
  information for optimization.}

\paragraph{Committing to alternatives.}

The \?commit()? function of \?NoneMin? can safely assume that the
choice \?c? passed as argument is in fact an object \?pv? of
class \?PosVal?. This is due to the fact that the space
\?commit()? function uses the identity stored in a choice object
to find the corresponding brancher.
\insertlitcode{none min:commit}

From the \?PosVal? object the position of the view \?pos? and the
value \?val? are extracted. Then, if the commit is for the first
alternative (\?a? is \?0?), the brancher assigns the view
\?x[pos]? to \?val? using the view modification operation \?eq?
(see \autoref{fig:p:started:modify}). If the modification
operation returns a modification event signaling failure,
\?me_failed? is true and hence the execution status \?ES_FAILED?
is returned. Otherwise, \?ES_OK? is returned as execution
status. If the commit is for the second alternative (\?a? is
\?1?), the value \?val? is excluded from the view \?x[pos]?.


\subsection{Improving status and choice}
\label{sec:b:started:nonemin:improved}

The \?status()? and \?choice()? functions of \?NoneMin? as
defined in \autoref{fig:b:started:nonemin} are inefficient as
they always inspect the entire view array for finding the first
unassigned view.

\begin{figure}[p]
\insertlitcode{none min improved}
\caption{An improved brancher for \?nonemin?}
\label{fig:b:started:improved}
\end{figure}

The brancher shown in \autoref{fig:b:started:improved} stores an
integer \?start? to remember which of the views in \?x? are
already assigned. The brancher maintains the invariant
that all $\mathtt{x}_i$ are assigned for $0\leq
i<\mathtt{start}$. The value of \?start? will be updated by the
\?status()? function which must be declared as \?const?. As
\?start? is updated by a \?const?-function, it is declared as
\?mutable?. 

The \?choice()? function of an improved \?NoneMin? brancher can
rely on the fact that \?x[start]?  is the first unassigned view
in the view array \?x?.


\section{Implementing a \?sizemin? branching}
\label{sec:b:started:sizemin}

This section presents an example for a brancher that
implements a more interesting selection of the view to branch
on. The branching
\begin{code}
void sizemin(Home home, const IntVarArgs& x);
\end{code}
branches by selecting the variable in \?x? with smallest domain
size first and tries to assign the selected variable to its smallest
possible value. That is, \?sizemin? is equivalent to the
predefined branching (see \autoref{sec:m:branch:int}) if
used as
\begin{code}
branch(home, x, INT_VAR_SIZE_MIN(), INT_VAL_MIN());
\end{code}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{size min}
\caption{A brancher for \?sizemin?}
\label{fig:b:started:sizemin}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:b:started:sizemin} shows the brancher \?SizeMin?
implementing the \?sizemin? branching. The \?status()? function
is not shown as it is exactly the same function as for \?NoneMin?
from the previous section: after all, the brancher is done only
after all of its views are assigned. Likewise, the \?PosVal?
choice and the \?commit()? function are unchanged.

The \?choice()? function uses the integer \?p? for the position
of the unassigned view with the so-far smallest domain size and
the unsigned integer \?s? for the so-far smallest size. Then, all
views that are not known to be assigned are scanned to find the
view with smallest domain size. Keep in mind that due to the
invariant enforced by the brancher's \?status()?  function,
\?x[start]? is not assigned.

It is absolutely essential to skip already assigned
views. If assigned views were not skipped, then the same choice
would be created over and over again leading to an infinite
search tree.


\section{Assignment branchers}
\label{sec:b:started:assign}

This section presents an example for a brancher that assigns all
of its views rather than branches on its views.  The branching
\begin{code}
void assignmin(Home home, const IntVarArgs& x);
\end{code}
assigns all variables in \?x? to their smallest possible
value. That is, \?assignmin? is equivalent to the predefined
branching (see \autoref{sec:m:branch:assign}) used as
\begin{code}
assign(home, x, INT_ASSIGN_MIN);
\end{code}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{assign min}
\caption{A brancher for \?assignmin?}
\label{fig:b:started:assignmin}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:b:started:assignmin} shows the relevant parts of the
brancher \?AssignMin?. Unsurprisingly, both the \?status()? and
\?choice()? function are identical to those shown in
\autoref{fig:b:started:improved} (and hence are omitted). 

The changes concern the created choice of type \?PosVal?: the
constructor now initializes a choice with a single alternative
only (the second argument to the call of the constructor
\?Choice?). The \?commit()? function is a specialized version of
the \?commit()? function defined in
\autoref{fig:b:started:improved}. It only needs to be capable of
handling a single alternative.


\section{Using variable views}
\label{sec:b:started:views}

Variable views can also be used for reusing branchers to obtain
several branchings, similar to reusing propagators for several
constraints, see \autoref{chap:p:views}.

While in principle all different variable views introduced in
\autoref{chap:p:views} can be used for branchers, the only
meaningful variable view for branchers is the minus integer view
(see \autoref{sec:p:views:int:minus}).

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{none min and none max}
\caption{Branchings for \?nonemin? and \?nonemax?}
\label{fig:b:started:views}
\end{figure}

As an example consider the branchings
\?nonemin? (see \autoref{sec:b:started:nonemin}) and \?nonemax?
where the latter tries to assign the maximal value of a view
first. The corresponding program fragment is shown in
\autoref{fig:b:started:views}. The class \?NoneMin? is made
generic with respect to the type of view it uses. Then, both
\?nonemin? and \?nonemax? can be obtained by instantiating
\?NoneMin? with integer views or integer minus views.

\chapter{Propagators for set constraints}
\label{chap:p:sets}

This chapter shows how to implement propagators for constraints
over set variables. We assume that you have worked through the
chapters on implementing integer propagators, as most of the
techniques readily carry over and are not explained again
here.

We also assume a basic knowledge of propagation for set
constraints. To read more about this topic, please refer
to~\cite{Gervet:1995:0:Finite, Tack:PhD:2009}.

\paragraph{Overview.}

\mbox{}\autoref{sec:p:sets:simple_example} demonstrates a
propagator that implements set interesection. 
Set views and their related concepts are summarized in
\autoref{sec:p:sets:propagation_conditions_etc}.


\section{A simple example}
\label{sec:p:sets:simple_example}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{intersection}
\caption{A constraint and propagator for set intersection}
\label{fig:p:sets:intersection}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:p:sets:intersection} shows a propagator for the
ternary intersection constraint
$\mathtt{x}_0\cap\mathtt{x}_1=\mathtt{x}_2$ for three set
variables $\mathtt{x}_0$, $\mathtt{x}_1$, and $\mathtt{x}_2$.

As you can see, propagators for set constraints follow exactly
the same structure as propagators for integer or Boolean
constraints. The same propagator patterns can be used (see
\autoref{sec:p:started:patterns}). The appropriate views and
propagation conditions are defined in the namespace
\gecoderef[namespace]{Gecode::Set}.

In order to understand the \?propagate()? function, we have to look
at how set variable domains are represented.

\paragraph{The set bounds approximation.}

We already saw in \autoref{chap:m:set} that set variable domains
are represented as intervals in order to avoid an exponential
representation. For example, recall that
$$\big\{\;\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{2,3\}\;\big\}$$ cannot
be captured exactly by an interval, but is instead approximated by the
smallest enclosing interval $\range{\{\}}{\{1,2,3\}}$.

Set propagators therefore access and modify the interval bounds.
Naturally, set-valued domain operations similar to the ones for
integer variables (see \autoref{chap:p:domain}) play an important
role for set propagators.

For each set view, \gecoderef[class]{Set::GlbRanges} provides a
range iterator for its lower bound, and
\gecoderef[class]{Set::LubRanges} iterates the upper bound. The
main iterator-based modification operations on set views are
\?includeI? (adding a set to the lower bound), \?excludeI?
(removing a set from the upper bound), and \?intersectI?
(intersecting the upper bound with a set).

\paragraph{Filtering rules.}


Coming back to the example propagator for ternary intersection,
we have to devise filtering rules that express the constraint in
terms of the interval bounds. In the following, we write
$\underline{x}$ and $\overline{x}$ for the lower bound resp.\ 
upper bound of a view $x$. Then, ternary intersection can be
propagated with the following rules and implemented with set
domain operations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\underline{\mathtt{x}_0}\cap\underline{\mathtt{x}_1}\subseteq\mathtt{x}_2$
  \insertsmalllitcode{intersection:rule 1}
  \item $\overline{\mathtt{x}_0}\cap\overline{\mathtt{x}_1}\supseteq\mathtt{x}_2$
  \insertsmalllitcode{intersection:rule 2}
  \item $\underline{\mathtt{x}_2}\subseteq\mathtt{x}_0$
  \insertsmalllitcode{intersection:rule 3}
  \item $\underline{\mathtt{x}_2}\subseteq\mathtt{x}_1$
  \insertsmalllitcode{intersection:rule 4}
  \item $\underline{\mathtt{x}_0}\setminus\overline{\mathtt{x}_2}\not\subseteq\mathtt{x}_1$
  \insertsmalllitcode{intersection:rule 5}
  \item $\underline{\mathtt{x}_1}\setminus\overline{\mathtt{x}_2}\not\subseteq\mathtt{x}_0$
  \insertsmalllitcode{intersection:rule 6}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{integer-valued bounds operations}}\\
\?glbMin()? / \?glbMax()? & Return minimum/maximum of lower bound\\
\?lubMin()? / \?lubMax()? & Return minimum/maximum of upper bound\\
\?glbSize()? / \?lubSize()? & Return size of lower/upper bound\\
\?unknownSize()? & Return number of elements in upper but not in lower bound\\
\?contains()? & test whether lower bound contains element\\
\?notContains()? & test whether upper bound does not contain element\\
\?include()? & add element (or range) to lower bound\\
\?exclude()? & remove element (or range) from upper bound\\
\?intersect()? & intersect upper bound with element or range\\
\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{set-valued bounds modifications}}\\
\?includeI()? & add elements to lower bound\\
\?excludeI()? & remove elements from upper bound\\
\?intersectI()? & intersect upper bound with given set\\
\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{cardinality operations}}\\
\?cardMin()? & Return/modify minimum cardinality\\
\?cardMax()? & Return/modify maximum cardinality\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Set view operations}
\label{fig:p:sets:view_operations}
\end{figure}

The first four rules should be self-explanatory. The last two
rules state that anything that is in $\mathtt{x}_0$ but not in
$\mathtt{x}_2$ cannot be in $\mathtt{x}_1$ (and the same for
$\mathtt{x}_0$ and $\mathtt{x}_1$ swapped).  The full list of
operations on set views appears in
\autoref{fig:p:sets:view_operations}.


\paragraph{Fixpoint.}

Note how the propagator determines which execution status to
return. Before applying any of the filtering rules, it checks
whether all of the variables are already assigned. If they are, then
propagation will compute a fixpoint and the propagator can return
that it is subsumed after applying the filtering rules.
Otherwise, it has not necessarily computed a fixpoint (e.g.\ 
rule~6 may modify the upper bound of $\mathtt{x}_0$, making it
necessary to apply rule~2 again).

\paragraph{Cardinality.}

In addition to the interval bounds, set variables store
\emph{cardinality bounds}, that is, the minimum and maximum
cardinality of the set variable. These bounds are stored and modified
independently of the interval bounds, but of course modifications to these
different bounds affect each other.

For example, consider a set variable with a domain represented by the
interval $\range{\{\}}{\{1,2\}}$ and the cardinality $\#\range{1}{2}$. Adding $1$ to
the lower bound would result in the cardinality lower bound being
increased to $1$. Removing $1$ from the upper bound would result in
$2$ being added to the lower bound to satisfy the minimum cardinality
of $1$.

Using cardinality information, propagation for some set
constraints can be strengthened. For the ternary intersection example,
we can for instance add the following filtering rules:
\insertlitcode{intersection:cardinality}

When dealing with cardinality, it is important to
handle overflow or signedness issues. In the above example, we
have to check whether \?x0.cardMin()+x1.cardMin()>s?, because
otherwise the expression \?x0.cardMin()+x1.cardMin()-s? may
underflow (as we are dealing with unsigned integers here). This
is not the case for the second cardinality rule. Here, we can be
sure that the size of the union of the lower bounds is always
greater than the sum of the maximum cardinalities.


\section{Modification events, propagation conditions, views,
   and advisors}
\label{sec:p:sets:propagation_conditions_etc}

This section summarizes how these concepts are
specialized for set variables and propagators.

\paragraph{Modification events and propagation conditions.}

\begin{figure}[p]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{set modification events}}\\
\?Set::ME_SET_NONE? & the view has not been changed\\
\?Set::ME_SET_FAILED? & the domain has become empty\\
\?Set::ME_SET_VAL? & the view has been assigned to a single set\\
\?Set::ME_SET_CARD? & the view has been assigned to a single set\\
\?Set::ME_SET_LUB? & the upper bound has been changed\\
\?Set::ME_SET_GLB? & the lower bound has been changed\\
\?Set::ME_SET_BB? & both bounds have been changed\\
\?Set::ME_SET_CLUB? & cardinality and upper bound have changed\\
\?Set::ME_SET_CGLB? & cardinality and lower bound have changed\\
\?Set::ME_SET_CBB? & cardinality and both bounds have changed\\
\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{set propagation conditions}}\\
\?Set::PC_SET_VAL? & schedule when the view is assigned\\
\?Set::PC_SET_CARD? & schedule when the cardinality changes\\
\?Set::PC_SET_CLUB? & schedule when the cardinality or the upper bound changes\\
\?Set::PC_SET_CGLB? & schedule when the cardinality or the lower bound changes\\
\?Set::PC_SET_ANY? & schedule at any change\\
\?Set::PC_SET_NONE? & do not schedule\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Set modification events and propagation conditions}
\label{fig:p:sets:propagation_conditions}
\end{figure}

The modification events and propagation conditions for set
propagators (see
\autoref{fig:p:sets:propagation_conditions}) capture the
parts of a set variable domain that can change.

One could imagine a richer set, for example distinguishing
between lower and upper bound changes of the cardinality, or
separating the cardinality changes from the interval bound
changes. However, the number of propagation conditions has a
direct influence on the size of a variable, see
\autoref{par:v:varimp:design:cost}. Just like for integer views,
this set of modification events and propagation conditions has
been chosen as a compromise between expressiveness on the one
hand, and keeping the set small on the other.


\paragraph{Set variable views.}

In addition to the basic \gecoderef[class]{Set::SetView} class,
there are five other set views:
\gecoderef[class]{Set::ConstSetView},
\gecoderef[class]{Set::EmptyView},
\gecoderef[class]{Set::UniverseView},
\gecoderef[class]{Set::SingletonView}, and
\gecoderef[class]{Set::ComplementView}.

The first three are constant views. A \?SingletonView? wraps an
integer view $x$ in the interface of a set view, so that it
acts like the singleton set $\{x\}$. A \?ComplementView? is like
Boolean negation, it provides the set complement with respect to
the global Gecode universe for set variables (defined as
$\range{\mathtt{Set::Limits::min}}{\mathtt{Set::Limits::max}}$,
see \gecoderef[namespace]{Set::Limits}).

\paragraph{Advisors for set propagators.}

Advisors for set constraints get informed about the domain
modifications using a \gecoderef[class]{Set::SetDelta}. The set delta
provides only information about the minimum and maximum values
that were added to the lower bound and/or removed from the upper
bound.

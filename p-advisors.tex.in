\chapter{Advisors}
\label{chap:p:advisors}

This chapter is concerned with advisors for efficient
incremental propagation. Advisors can be used to provide
information to a propagator which of its views have changed and
how they have changed.

\paragraph{Overview.}

In \autoref{sec:p:advisors:advisors}, a motivation and a model
for advisors is presented. The following two sections demonstrate
advisors. \autoref{sec:p:advisors:samedom} shows an example
propagator that exploits the information provided by an advisor
about which view has changed. \autoref{sec:p:advisors:or} shows
an example propagator that exploits information on how the domain
of its views have changed. \autoref{sec:p:advisors:force}
sketches how advisors can be used for forcing propagators to be
rescheduled.


\section{Advisors for incremental propagation}
\label{sec:p:advisors:advisors}

Consider the following, rather simple, example constraint. The
constraint \?samedom? for an array of integer variables \?x? and
an integer set \?d? holds, if and only if: 
\begin{itemize}
\item either all variables
in \?x? take values from \?d? (that is, $\mathtt{x}_i\in\mathtt
d$ for $0\leq i<|\mathtt{x}|$),
\item or none of the \?x? take values in
\?d? (that is, $\mathtt{x}_i\not\in\mathtt d$ for $0\leq
  i<|\mathtt{x}|$).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{More knowledge is needed.}

Obviously, there are two different approaches to realize \?samedom?:
\begin{description}
\item[decomposition] We decompose the \?samedom? constraint as
  follows. We create a Boolean variable $\mathtt{b}$ and post
  reified \?dom? constraints (see
  \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelIntDomain}) such that
  $\reify{\mathtt{x}_i\in\mathtt{d}}{\mathtt{b}}$ (for $0\leq
  i<|\mathtt{x}|$). As the single Boolean variable \?b? is the same
  for all reified \?dom? constraints, \?samedom? is automatically
  enforced.
  
\item[implementation] A different approach is to implement a
  dedicated propagator for \?samedom?. Propagation is quite
  simple: whenever the propagator is executed, try to find a view
  among the $\mathtt{x}_i$ such that either
  $\mathtt{x}_i\in\mathtt d$ or $\mathtt{x}_i\not\in\mathtt d$.
  If there is no such $\mathtt{x}_i$, the propagator is at
  fixpoint. Otherwise, the propagator constrains all
  $\mathtt{x}_i$ accordingly.
\end{description}

Let us compare the individual merits of the two approaches (note
that both achieve domain consistency).  Decomposition requires
$O(|\mathtt x|)$ propagators consuming quite some memory.
Implementation requires a single propagator only and hence has a
lower overhead both for runtime (only a single propagator needs
to be scheduled) and memory consumption.

However, the implementation approach is dreadful and is in fact
less efficient than decomposition! The problem is the ``try to
find a view'' approach: each time the propagator is executed, it
only knows that some of its views have changed since last time
the propagator has been executed. It just does not know which
views changed!  That is, each time the propagator is executed, it
needs to scan all its views. For \?samedom?, the propagator takes
$O(|\mathtt{x}|\cdot|\mathtt d|)$ runtime as scanning needs to inspect the entire domain of each view.  This is
considerably worse than decomposition: when the domain of a
$\mathtt{x}_i$ changes, only a single reified propagator for
\?dom?  is executed with cost $O(|\mathtt d|)$.

The problem is the little amount of information available to a
propagator when it is executed. The propagator only knows that
some of its views changed but not which views. Hence, just
finding out which views have changed always incurs linear cost in
the number of views. 

For a simple constraint such as \?samedom?, the linear overhead
is prohibitive. For more involved constraints, decomposition
might be infeasible as it would compromise propagation (think of
domain consistent \?distinct? as an example).

\paragraph{Advisors.}

Gecode provides \emph{advisors} to inform propagators about view
changes. An advisor belongs to a propagator and can be defined
(by inheriting from \gecoderef[class]{Advisor}) to store
information as needed by its propagator. The sole purpose of an
advisor is to subscribe to a view of its propagator: each time
the view changes, an \?advise()? function of the advisor's
propagator is executed with the advisor as argument (sometimes
we will be a little sloppy by saying that the advisor is executed
itself).

In more detail:
\begin{itemize}
\item An advisor must inherit from the class
  \gecoderef[class]{Advisor}.
\item When an advisor is created, it is created with respect to
  its propagator and a \emph{council} of advisors. Each advisor
  belongs to a council and a propagator can have at most one
  council. The sole purpose of a council is to manage its
  advisors for cloning and disposal. In particular, when the
  propagator is disposed, the council must be disposed as well.
  
  A council also provides access to all of its advisors (we will
  exploit this in the following sections).
\item An advisor can subscribe to views (and, hence, an advisor
  subscription like any other subscription must eventually be
  canceled). Unlike subscriptions of propagators to views,
  subscriptions of advisors do not use propagation conditions: an
  advisor is always executed when its subscription view changes.
  
  Also, an advisor is never executed when the subscription is
  created, only when the subscription view changes.
  
\item An advisor is executed as follows: the \?advise()? function
  of its propagator is executed. The function takes the advisor
  as argument and an additional argument of type
  \gecoderef[class]{Delta}. The \emph{delta} describes how the
  domain of the view has changed. Clearly, which kind of
  information a delta provides depends on the type of the view.
  Deltas, in particular, provide access to the modification event
  of the operation that triggered the advisor's execution.
  
  For integer and Boolean views, deltas provide some approximate
  information about which values have been removed. For an
  example, see \autoref{sec:p:advisors:or}.
  
\item The \?advise()? function is \emph{not} allowed to perform
  propagation by executing modification operations on views. It
  can change the state of the propagator and must return an
  execution status: \?ES_FAILED? means that the propagator is
  failed; \?ES_FIX? means that the propagator is at fixpoint
  (hence, it is not scheduled); \?ES_NOFIX? means that the
  propagator is not any longer at fixpoint (hence, it is
  scheduled). That is, an advisor does exactly what its name
  suggests as it provides advice to its propagator: when should
  the propagator be executed and the advisor can also provide
  information for the next propagator execution.
  
  The \?advise()? function can also return after calling the
  functions \?ES_FIX_DISPOSE()? or \?ES_NOFIX_DISPOSE()? which
  are analogous to \?ES_FIX? and \?ES_NOFIX? but also dispose the
  advisor.
  
  There are two more functions that force the advisor's
  propagator to be rescheduled. They are discussed in
  \autoref{sec:p:advisors:force}.
\end{itemize}

Note that a propagator using advisors must make sure that its
advisors schedule the propagator when it is not at fixpoint.
Otherwise, it would not meet its ``subscription
complete'' obligation (make sure to read
\autoref{tip:p:advisors:started}). A propagator is free to mix
subscriptions using advisors and subscriptions using propagation
conditions, see \autoref{sec:p:advisors:or}.

For more information on advisors including design and
evaluation, see \cite{LagerkvistSchulte:CP:2007}.


\section{The \?samedom? constraint}
\label{sec:p:advisors:samedom}

The idea how the \?SameDom? propagator implements the \?samedom?
constraint is straightforward. The propagator creates an advisor
for each of its views and as soon as the \?advise()? function
decides for one of the views \?x? that either
$\mathtt{x}\subseteq\mathtt{d}$ or
$\mathtt{x}\cap\mathtt{d}=\emptyset$ holds, the propagator is
informed what it has to do and is scheduled. Then, the propagator
performs the required propagation and becomes subsumed. That is,
a \?SameDom? propagator is executed at most once.

\paragraph{Todo information.}

\begin{samepage}
A \?SameDom? propagator stores in \?todo? what it has to do when
it is executed:
\insertlitcode{samedom:todo information}
\end{samepage}

Initially, \?todo? is \?NOTHING?. When the propagator is
scheduled on behalf of an advisor \?todo? is either \?INCLUDE?
(that is, the propagator must propagate that
$\mathtt{x}_i\subseteq\mathtt d$ for $0\leq i<|\mathtt{x}|$) or
\?EXCLUDE? (that is, the propagator must propagate that
$\mathtt{x}_i\cap\mathtt d=\emptyset$ for $0\leq
i<|\mathtt{x}|$).

\paragraph{View advisors.}

Each advisor used by the \?SameDom? propagator stores the view it
is subscribed to. By this, the \?advise()? function can use the
view stored with an advisor to decide what the propagator needs to
do. A view advisor is defined as follows:
\insertlitcode{samedom:advisor}

An advisor must implement a constructor for creation which takes
the home space, the advisor's propagator, and the council of
advisors as arguments. Additionally, a view advisor also takes
the view as input and subscribes to the view.

An advisor does neither have an \?update()? nor a \?copy()?
function, a constructor for cloning with the typical arguments is
sufficient. The \?dispose()?  function of an advisor does not
have to report the advisor's size (in contrast to a propagator's
\?dispose()?  function).

The propagator maintains a council of view advisors \?c?. A
council controls disposal and copying during cloning. Moreover, a
council provides access to all advisors in the council (where
already disposed advisors are excluded). The \?SameDom? propagator
does not store its views explicitly in a view array. As the
council provides access to its advisors, all views can be
accessed from the council's advisors.

\tip{Different types of advisors for the same propagator}{ Any
  propagator that uses advisors must have exactly one council. As
  the council depends on the advisor type, only one advisor type
  per propagator is possible. 

  This is not a real restriction. If several different types of
  advisors are needed, one can either use advisors with virtual
  member functions or encode the advisor's type by some member
  stored by the advisor.}

\paragraph{The propagator proper.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{samedom}
\caption{A \?samedom? propagator using advisors}
\label{fig:p:advisors:samedom}
\end{figure}

The \?SameDom? propagator is shown in
\autoref{fig:p:advisors:samedom}. The function
\?include(home,x,d)?  constrains the view \?x? to only take
values from \?d?, whereas \?exclude(home,x,d)? constrains the
view \?x? to not take any values from \?d?. The function
\?dom(x,d)? returns whether the values for \?x?  are included in
\?d? (\?INCLUDE? is returned) or whether values for \?x? are
excluded from \?d? (\?EXCLUDE? is returned). All these functions
are implemented with range iterators as discussed in
\autoref{chap:p:domain}.

\paragraph{Posting the propagator.}

The propagator post function (not shown) makes sure that the
propagator is only posted if for all views $\mathtt{x}_i$, it
cannot be decided whether $\mathtt{x}_i\in\mathtt d$ or
$\mathtt{x}_i\not\in\mathtt d$. If this is not the case, the post
function already performs the necessary propagation. Note that
the propagator post function by performing some propagation
ensures the central invariant of the \?SameDom? propagator: the
value of \?todo?  (which is \?NOTHING? initially) corresponds to
the current domains of the propagator's views.

The constructor for posting creates the required advisors as
follows: 
\insertlitcode{samedom:constructor for posting}

\tip{Getting a propagator started with advisors}{ 
\label{tip:p:advisors:started}%
The \?SameDom?
  propagator has the property that when it is posted, it is known
  to be at fixpoint (the \?post()? function ensures this by
  checking for each view $\mathtt{x}_i$ whether
  $\mathtt{x}_i\in\mathtt d$ or $\mathtt{x}_i\not\in\mathtt d$).

In general, it might not be true that a propagator using advisors
is at fixpoint when it is posted. In that case, the constructor
of the propagator must not only create advisors but also make
sure that the propagator is scheduled for execution.

A propagator can be scheduled by using the static \?schedule()? function
of a view. For example, assume that the propagator to be
scheduled should be scheduled because one of its integer views of
type \?IntView? is
assigned. This can be achieved by:
\begin{code}
IntView::schedule(home, *this, ME_INT_VAL);
\end{code}
where \?*this? refers to the current propagator. 

Likewise,
\begin{code}
IntView::schedule(home, *this, ME_INT_BND);
\end{code}
schedules the propagator with the information that the bounds
of some of its integer views have changed.
}

\paragraph{Mandatory propagator disposal.}

The constructor also puts a notice on the propagator that it must
always be disposed, even if the home space is deleted (as
discussed in \autoref{sec:p:started:obligations}). Putting a
notice is required because the integer set \?d?  of type
\gecoderef[class]{IntSet} is a proper data structure and must
hence be deleted when a \?SameDom? propagator is disposed.

Accordingly, the \?dispose()? function deletes the integer set
\?d? as follows:
\insertlitcode{samedom:disposal}

Disposing the council \?c? also disposes all view advisors. 
Hence, also all subscriptions are canceled (as the \?dispose()?
function of a \?ViewAdvisor? cancels its subscription).

It is essential to ignore the notice in \?dispose()? by calling
\?home.notice()?: otherwise Gecode might attempt to dispose a now
already disposed propagator just over and over again!

\paragraph{Propagation with advice.}

The \?advise()? function is straightforward:
\insertlitcode{samedom:advise function}

If \?todo? is already different from \?NOTHING?, the propagator
has already been scheduled, and the \?advise()?
function returns \?ES_FIX? to signal that the propagator does not
need to be scheduled again.\footnote{Actually, it would also be
  okay to return \?ES_NOFIX?. Scheduling an already scheduled
  propagator is okay.} Otherwise, depending on the result of
\?dom()?, the \?advise()? function updates the \?todo? value of
the propagator and returns \?ES_NOFIX? if the propagator needs
scheduling (as \?todo? is different from \?NOTHING?).

Note that the \?advise()? function of \?SameDom? ignores its
\?Delta? argument. In the next section we will see a
complementary design: the advisor does not carry any information,
but only uses the information provided by the \?Delta?.

The \?propagate()? member function is exactly as to be expected:
\insertlitcode{samedom:propagation}

The \?Advisors? class provides an iterator over all advisors in
the council \?c?. As mentioned earlier, the iterator (and hence
the council) provides sufficient information to retrieve all
views of interest for propagation.

\tip{Advisors and propagator obligations}{ The astute reader
  might have wondered whether a \?SameDom?  propagator is
  actually ``update complete'' in the sense of
  \autoref{sec:p:started:obligations}. The answer is yes, because
  the council copies all of its view advisors and each view
  advisor updates its view in turn.  

  Likewise, the obligations ``subscription complete'' and
  ``subscription correct'' need to be satisfied regardless of
  whether a propagator uses propagator condition-based or
  advisor-based subscriptions to views.  }

\paragraph{Advisor disposal.}

The \?SameDom? propagator leaves the disposal of its advisors to
its own \?dispose()? function. However, it could also request
disposal of an advisor in the \?advise()? function itself. A
different implementation of the advise function would be:
\begin{code}
if (todo != NOTHING)
  return home.ES_FIX_DISPOSE(c,static_cast<ViewAdvisor&>(a));
todo = dom(static_cast<ViewAdvisor&>(a).x,d);
return (todo == NOTHING) ? ES_FIX : 
  home.ES_NOFIX_DISPOSE(c,static_cast<ViewAdvisor&>(a));
\end{code}

With this design, all advisors would be disposed on behalf of the
\?advise()? function and not by the propagator's \?dispose()?
function. This is due to the following two facts:
\begin{itemize}
\item A single advisor finds out that \?todo? must be either
  \?EXCLUDE? or \?INCLUDE?. This advisor returns
  \?ES_NOFIX_DISPOSE()? and hence is disposed.
\item All other advisors will be executed at the very latest when
  the propagator performs propagation and are disposed as well.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Using predefined view advisors.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{samedom using predefined view advisors}
\caption{A \?samedom? propagator using predefined view advisors}
\label{fig:p:advisors:samedomview}
\end{figure}

Unsurprisingly, view advisors are a common abstraction for
propagators using advisors. Hence, Gecode provides view advisors
as predefined abstractions that are parametric with respect to
their view type. \autoref{fig:p:advisors:samedomview} shows how
\?SameDom? can be implemented using predefined view advisors.


\section{General Boolean disjunction}
\label{sec:p:advisors:or}

Let us consider an efficient propagator \?Or? for implementing the Boolean
disjunction 
$$\bigvee_{i=0}^{|\mathtt{x}|-1} \mathtt{x}_i=\mathtt{y}$$
where all
$\mathtt{x}_i$ and $\mathtt y$ are Boolean views.  When \?y?
becomes assigned, propagation is straightforward. If \?y? is
assigned to \?0?, all $\mathtt{x}_i$ must be assigned to \?0? as
well.  If \?y? is assigned to \?1?, \?Or? is rewritten into the
propagator \?OrTrue? from \autoref{sec:p:avoid:dynamic}.

As it comes to the $\mathtt{x}_i$, the \?Or? propagator uses
a similar technique to the \?SameDom? propagator. It can use
advisors to find out which view has been assigned
instead of inspecting all $\mathtt{x}_i$. However, the propagator
requires very little information: it does not need to know which
view has changed, it only needs to know whether a view among
the $\mathtt{x}_i$ has been assigned to \?0? or \?1?. Our \?Or?
propagator uses the delta information passed to the
\?advise()? function to determine the value to which a view has
been assigned. The advantage is that the propagator only
needs a single advisor instead of one advisor per view.

\tip{Advisor space requirements}{ A subscription requires one
  pointer, regardless of whether a propagator or an advisor
  is subscribed to a view. Without any additional information stored
  by an advisor, an advisor requires two pointers. Hence, it pays
  off to use as few advisors as possible.  }

\paragraph{The \?Or? propagator.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{or}
\caption{A Boolean disjunction propagator using advisors}
\label{fig:p:advisors:or}
\end{figure}

The \?Or? propagator inherits from the
\gecoderef[class]{MixNaryOnePropagator} template (to increase
readability, a base class \?OrBase? is defined as a type) and uses
\?PC_BOOL_NONE? as propagation condition for the views in the
view array \?x?. That actually means that no subscriptions are
created for the views in \?x?. A subscription with
propagation condition \?PC_BOOL_VAL? is created for the single
Boolean view \?y?. The constructor for posting creates a single
advisor which subscribes to all views in \?x?. In fact, the \?Or?
propagator mixes advisors with normal subscriptions.

The \?advise()? function uses the delta
information to decide whether one of the views the advisor has
subscribed to is assigned to \?0? (then \?Int::BoolView::zero()?
returns true):
\insertlitcode{or:advise}

The advise function counts the number of views assigned to zero
in \?n_zero?. It reports that the propagator must be scheduled,
if all views have been assigned to zero (that is, \?n_zero?
equals the number of views in \?x?) or if a view has been
assigned to one. Note that the propagator post function makes
sure that the propagator is only posted when none of the views in
\?x? are assigned.

The \?propagate()? function is straightforward:
\insertlitcode{or:propagation}
It first checks whether the propagator has been executed because
\?y? has been assigned and propagates as sketched before. Then it
uses the value of \?n_zero? to determine how to propagate.

\paragraph{Delta information for integer views.}
\label{par:p:advisors:delta}

The delta information provided to the \?advise()?  function can
be interpreted through the view the advisor has subscribed to.
Boolean views provide static member functions \?zero()? and
\?one()? to find out whether the view has been assigned to \?0?
or \?1?.

For integer views (and set views, see
\autoref{sec:p:sets:propagation_conditions_etc}), one must use
the view to which the advisor has subscribed to for accessing the
delta. 

\begin{samepage}
For example, suppose that the advisor \?a? has subscribed
to the view \?x? by
\begin{code}
x.subscribe(home,a);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
When the \?advise()? function is executed for the advisor
\?a? with delta \?d?, the view \?x? provides access to the delta
information (typically, this will mean that \?a? in fact stores
the view \?x?).

The modification event of the operation that modified the view
\?x? is available by \?x.modevent(d)?. If \?x.any(d)? returns
true, no further information about how the domain of \?x?
has changed is available. Only if \?x.any(d)? is false,
\?x.min(d)? returns the previously (that is, the value before the domain
modification) smallest value of \?x? and \?x.max(d)? returns the
previously largest value of \?x?. With other words, the delta \?d? only
provides approximate information on how the old view domain has
been changed.

For Boolean views, one can rely on the fact that the delta
information is always accurate. For integer views, it might be
the case that \?x.any(d)? returns true even though only the
bounds of \?x? have changed.


\section{Forced propagator rescheduling}
\label{sec:p:advisors:force}

An advisor can force its propagator to be rescheduled even though
the propagator's modification event delta has not changed. As
discussed in \autoref{sec:p:domain:staging}, the \?cost()?
function of a propagator is only recomputed when its modification
event delta changes.

When the \?advise()? of a propagator returns
\?ES_NOFIX_FORCE? (or, the \?advise()? function calls
\?ES_NOFIX_DISPOSE_FORCE()?), the propagator is rescheduled
regardless of its current modification event delta. See also
\gecoderef[group]{TaskActorStatus}.

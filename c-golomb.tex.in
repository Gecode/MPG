%% FILES: CHAPTERONLY

This chapter studies a simple problem that is commonly used as an
example for constraint programming. The model uses nothing but a
single \?distinct? constraint, a few \?rel? constraints, and posts
linear expressions. As the problem is so well known, it might
serve as an initial case study of how to model with Gecode.


\section{Problem}
\label{sec:c:golomb:problem}

The problem is to find an optimal \emph{Golomb ruler} (see
\CSPLIB{6}) of size $n$. A Golomb ruler has $n$ marks
$0=\mathtt{m}_0<\mathtt{m}_1<\cdots<\mathtt{m}_{n-1}$
such that the distances
$\mathtt{d}_{i,j}=\mathtt{m}_j-\mathtt{m}_i$ for $0\leq i<j<n$
are pairwise distinct. An optimal Golomb ruler is of minimal length
(that is, $\mathtt{m}_{n-1}$ is minimal).
\autoref{fig:c:golomb:example} shows an optimal Golomb ruler with
$6$ marks.

In the model for Golomb rulers, we are going to use the following
construction for a Golomb ruler (a non-optimal ruler, though) as
it provides upper bounds on the values for the marks of a
ruler. The upper bounds improve the efficiency of our model,
see below for more details.

Assume that the distance between marks $i$ and $i+1$ is
$m_{i+1}-m_i=2^{i+1}$ (that is, for example, $m_1-m_0=1$,
$m_2-m_1=2$, $m_3-m_2=4$, and so on). Then the marks are
$$m_i=\sum_{k=1}^i 2^{k-1}=2^{i}-1.$$
\autoref{fig:c:golomb:constructed} shows a Golomb ruler with
$6$ marks following this construction.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\psset{unit=5mm}%
\begin{pspicture}(0,0.2)(31,2.7)
\psframe[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=GecodeBlue,opacity=0.3,dimen=middle](0,1)(31,2)%
\multiput(0,0)(1,0){31}{\psframe[linecolor=black,dimen=middle,linestyle=dotted](0,1)(1,2)}
\newcommand{\grmark}[2]{

}

\end{pspicture}
\caption{A constructed Golomb ruler with $6$ marks}
\label{fig:c:golomb:constructed}
\end{figure}

Now consider the bit representation of $m_i$: exactly the least
$i$ bits are one. For the distances
$$d_{i,j}=m_j-m_i=\sum_{k=1}^j 2^{k-1}-\sum_{k=1}^i 2^{k-1}$$
we can easily see that in their bit representation the least $i$
bits are zero, followed by $j-i$ ones. That means for $0\leq
i<j<n$ the bit representations of the $d_{i,j}$ are
pairwise distinct. In other words, we can always construct a
Golomb ruler with $n$ marks of length $m_{n-1}=2^{n-1}-1$.

\section{Model}
\label{sec:c:golomb:model}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{golomb}
\caption{A script for computing Golomb rulers}
\label{fig:c:golomb:script}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:c:golomb:script} shows the script for implementing
the Golomb ruler model. The script stores a variable array \?m?
for the marks. The largest possible value of a mark is set to
$2^{n-1}-1$ according to the construction of a Golomb ruler in
the previous section, provided that this value does not exceed
the possible size limit of an integer (integers in Gecode are at
least 32 bits, this is checked when Gecode is configured for
compilation). If $n\geq 31$ we just choose the largest possible
integer value for an integer variable (see
\gecoderef[namespace]{Int::Limits}). 

\tip{Small variable domains are still beautiful}{
\label{tip:c:golomb:beautifuldomains}%
As mentioned in \autoref{tip:m:integer:beautifuldomains},
initializing variable domains to be small makes sense. For
example, if we always chose \?Int::Limits::max? rather than the
smaller upper bounds for Golomb rulers with $n< 31$, the
propagators for \?linear? constraining the distances would have
to resort to extended precision as the internal computations
during propagation exceed the integer precision. That would mean
that scripts for $n< 31$ would run approximately 15\% slower!
}

The script does not store a variable array for the distances
(unlike the array for the marks), they are stored 
in an integer variable argument array.  As the
distances are only needed for posting constraints but not for
printing the solution, it is more efficient to store them in an
variable argument array but not in a variable array. More details
on argument arrays and their relation to variable arrays can be
found in \autoref{sec:m:integer:proper}.

The \?cost()? function as required by the class \?MinimizeScript?
(see \autoref{sec:m:driver:script}) just returns the largest mark
on the ruler.

\paragraph{Marks.}

Assigning the first mark to zero and ordering the marks in
increasing order is done by posting \?rel? constraints
(see \autoref{sec:m:integer:rel:int}):
\insertlitcode{golomb:constraining marks}

\paragraph{Distances.}

The number of marks \?n? and number of distances \?n_d? are
initialized so that they can be used for posting constraints:
\insertlitcode{golomb:number of marks and distances}

As mentioned, the distances are stored in an integer
variable argument array \?d?. The fields of the array \?d? are
initialized by the variable returned by the \?expr()? function
for linear expressions (see \autoref{sec:m:minimodel:exprrel}):
\insertlitcode{golomb:posting distance constraints}

One might be tempted to optimize the posting of distance constraints for
$\mathtt{d}_{0,j}$ for $0<j<n$ as $\mathtt{m}_0=0$ and hence
$\mathtt{d}_{0,j}=\mathtt{m}_j$ for $0<j<n$. Optimizing
avoids to create new variables (that is, the variables
$\mathtt{m}_j$ are stored as $\mathtt{d}_{0,j}$ for $0<j<n$)
and posting propagators to implement the equality constraints
$\mathtt{d}_{0,j}=\mathtt{m}_j$ for $0<j<n$.

However, the \?expr()? function does this automatically. As
$\mathtt{m}_0$ is already assigned by posting a \?rel?
constraint, the \?expr()? function simplifies the posted expressions
accordingly.

Finally, all distances must be pairwise distinct (see
\autoref{sec:m:integer:distinct}) where bounds propagation is
requested (see \autoref{sec:m:integer:ipl}):
\insertlitcode{golomb:distances must be distinct}
Intuitively, bounds propagation is sufficient as also the
propagation for the distances is using bounds propagation.

\paragraph{Implied constraints.}

The following implied constraints are due to \cite{Golomb}. A
distance $\mathtt{d}_{i,j}$ for $0\leq i<j<n$
satisfies the property that it is equal to the sum of all
distances between marks $\mathtt{m}_i$ and $\mathtt{m}_j$. That
is
$$
\mathtt{d}_{i,j} =
\mathtt{d}_{i,i+1} + 
\mathtt{d}_{i+1,i+2} + \cdots +
\mathtt{d}_{j-1,j}
$$

This can be verified as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathtt{d}_{i,j} 
&=&\mathtt{m}_j-\mathtt{m}_i\\
&=&(\mathtt{m}_{j} - \mathtt{m}_{j-1})
 + (\mathtt{m}_{j-1} - \mathtt{m}_{j-2})
 + \cdots
 + (\mathtt{m}_{i+1} - \mathtt{m}_{i})\\
&=&
\mathtt{d}_{j-1,j} + \mathtt{d}_{j-2,j-1} + \cdots +
\mathtt{d}_{i,i+1}\\
&=&
\mathtt{d}_{i,i+1} + 
\mathtt{d}_{i+1,i+2} + \cdots +
\mathtt{d}_{j-1,j}
\end{eqnarray*}

As all distances $\mathtt{d}_{i,j}$ for $0\leq i<j<n$
must be pairwise distinct, also the $j-i$ distances
$$
\mathtt{d}_{i,i+1}, 
\mathtt{d}_{i+1,i+2}, \ldots,
\mathtt{d}_{j-1,j}
$$
must be pairwise distinct and hence must be $j-i$ distinct integers. That
means that 
$$
\mathtt{d}_{i,j} =
\mathtt{d}_{i,i+1} + 
\mathtt{d}_{i+1,i+2} + \cdots +
\mathtt{d}_{j-1,j}
$$
must be at least the sum of the first $j-i$ integers:
$$
\mathtt{d}_{i,j} \geq \sum_{l=1}^{j-i} l=(j-i)(j-i+1)/2
$$

The implied constraints can be posted as a lower bound with a
\?rel? constraint (see \autoref{sec:m:integer:rel:int}) for the
distances as follows:
\insertlitcode{golomb:implied constraints}

Note that one could also combine the posting of the distance
constraints with constraining the lower bounds of the distances
for efficiency. However, we separate both for clarity. Anyway,
the time spent on posting constraints is insignificant to the
time spent on solving the model!

\paragraph{Symmetry breaking.}

Provided that the ruler has a sufficient number of marks (that
is, $\mathtt{n}>2$) we can break (a few) symmetries by constraining
the distance $\mathtt{d}_{0,1}$ (stored at the first position in the
array \?d?) between the first and second mark to be smaller than
the distance $\mathtt{d}_{\mathtt n-2,\mathtt n-1}$ (stored at
the last position in the array \?d?) between the
next to last and last mark as follows: 
\insertlitcode{golomb:symmetry breaking}

\paragraph{Branching.}

The branching chooses the marks from left to right on the ruler
and assigns the smallest possible value for a mark first:
\insertlitcode{golomb:branching}

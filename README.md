Modeling and Programming with Gecode
======

**Modeling and Programming with Gecode** (also known as **MPG**)
provides an introduction to modeling and programming with Gecode,
an open, free, portable, accessible, and efficient environment
for developing constraint-based systems and applications.

The hands-on, tutorial-style approach will get you started very
quickly. The focus is on giving an overview of the key concepts and
ideas required to model and program with Gecode. Each concept is
introduced using concrete C++ code examples that are developed and
explained step by step. This document is complemented by the complete
{Gecode reference documentation}, as well
as pointers to introductory and more advanced material throughout the
text.

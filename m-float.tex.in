\chapter{Float variables and constraints}
\label{chap:m:float}

This chapter gives an overview over float variables and float
constraints in Gecode. Just like \autoref{chap:m:int} does for
integer and Boolean variables, this chapter serves as a starting
point for using float variables. For the reference documentation,
please consult \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelFloat}.

\paragraph{Overview.}

\mbox{}\autoref{sec:m:float:val} explains float values whereas
\autoref{sec:m:float:var} explains float
variables.  The sections
\autoref{sec:m:float:post} and \autoref{sec:m:float:exec} provide
an overview of the constraints that are available for float
variables in Gecode.

\begin{important}
Do not forget to add
\begin{code}
#include <gecode/float.hh>
\end{code}
to your program when you want to use float variables. Note that
the same conventions hold as in \autoref{chap:m:int}.
\end{important}

\tip{Transcendental and trigonometric functions and constraints}{%
  \label{m:float:mpfr}
  When compiling Gecode, by default transcendental and
  trigonometric functions and constraints are disabled. In order to enable
  them, you have to install additional third-party
  libraries and provide additional options to the configuration
  of Gecode, see \autoref{par:m:started:mpfr}.
  
  To find out whether the functions and constraints are enabled,
  consult \autoref{tip:m:comfy:conf}.

\section{Float values and numbers}
\label{sec:m:float:val}

A \emph{floating point value} (short, \emph{float value}, see
\gecoderef[class]{FloatVal}) is represented as a closed interval
of two \emph{floating point numbers} (short, \emph{float number},
see \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelFloatVars}). That is, a float
value is a closed interval $\range{a}{b}$ which includes all real
numbers $n\in\RR$ such that $a\leq n$ and $n\leq b$. The float
number type \?FloatNum? is defined as \?double?.

The reason why a float value is not represented by a single
floating point number is that real numbers cannot be represented
exactly and that operations on floating point numbers perform
rounding. All operations (see below) on float values try to be as
\emph{accurate} as possible (so the interval $\range{a}{b}$ for a float
value is as small as possible) while being \emph{correct} (no
possible real number is ever excluded due to rounding).  The
classical reference on interval arithmetic is \cite{Moore:1966},
for more information see also the Wikipedia article on
\AURL{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic}{interval
  arithmetic}.

A float value \?x? represented by the interval $\range{a}{b}$ provides
many member functions such as \?min()? (returning $a$) and
\?max()? (returning $b$), see \gecoderef[class]{FloatVal}. The
float value \?x? is called \emph{tight} if $a$ equals $b$ or if
$b$ is the smallest representable float number larger than
$a$. If \?x? is tight, \?x.tight()? returns \?true?. 

A float value can be initialized from a single float number such
as in
\begin{code}
FloatVal x(1.0);
\end{code}
or from two float numbers such as in
\begin{code}
FloatVal x(0.9999,1.0001);
\end{code}

Float numbers (and other numbers) are automatically cast to
float values if needed, for example in
\begin{code}
FloatVal x=1.0;
\end{code}
or
\begin{code}
FloatVal x=1;
\end{code}


\paragraph{Predefined float values.}

The static member functions \?pi_half()?,
\?pi()?, and \?pi_twice()? of \gecoderef[class]{FloatVal} return float
values for 
$\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\pi$, and $2\pi$ respectively.

\paragraph{Arithmetic operators.}

For float values, the standard arithmetic operators \?+?, \?-?,
\?*?, and  \?/? and their assignment variants \?+=?, \?-=?,
\?*=?, and \?/=? are defined with the obvious meaning.

\paragraph{Comparison operators.}

The usual float value comparisons \?==?, \?!=?, \?<=?, \?<?,
\?>?, and \?>=? are provided with \emph{entailment} semantics (or
subsumption semantics).

For example, the comparison
\begin{code}
x < y
\end{code}
returns \?true? if and only if \?x.max()<y.min()? returns
\?true?. That means, \?x<y? returns \?false? if either \?x? is
larger or equal than \?y? or it cannot yet be decided: both \?x?
and \?y? still represent values which are both smaller and
greater or equal.

\end{figure}

\mbox{}\autoref{fig:m:float:val:fun} lists the available functions on
float values. The functions marked as default are always
supported, the others only if Gecode has been built accordingly,
see \autoref{m:float:mpfr}.


\section{Float variables}
\label{sec:m:float:var}

Float variables in Gecode model sets of real numbers and are instances
of the class \gecoderef[class]{FloatVar}.

\tip{Still do not use views for modeling}{%
  Just as for integer variables, you should not feel tempted to
  use views of float variables (such as \?FloatView?) for modeling.
  Views can only be used for implementing propagators and
  branchers, see \autoref{part:p} and \autoref{part:b}.
}

\paragraph{Representing float domains as intervals.}

The domain of a float variable is represented exactly as a float
value: a closed interval $\range{a}{b}$ which represents all real
numbers $n\in\RR$ such that $a\leq n$ and $n\leq b$. A float
variable is \emph{assigned} if the interval $\range{a}{b}$ is tight (see
\autoref{sec:m:float:val}).\footnote{Note that this means that a
  float variable is assigned even though its domain might still
  denote a set with more than one element. But this cannot be
  avoided as real numbers cannot be represented exactly.}

\paragraph{Creating a float variable.}

New float variables are created using a constructor.
A new float variable \?x? is created by
\begin{code}
FloatVar x(home, -1.0, 1.0);
\end{code}
This declares a variable \?x? of type \gecoderef[class]{FloatVar}
in the space \?home?, creates a new float variable implementation
with domain $\range{-1.0}{1.0}$, and makes \?x?  refer to the newly
created float variable implementation.

You find the full interface in the
reference documentation of the class \gecoderef[class]{FloatVar}.
An attempt to create a float variable with an empty domain throws
an exception of type \gecoderef[class]{Float::VariableEmptyDomain}.

As for integer variables, the default and copy constructors do not create new variable implementations. Instead, the
variable does not refer to any variable implementation (default
constructor) or to the same variable implementation (copy
constructor). For example in
\begin{code}
FloatVar x(home, -1.0, 1.0);
FloatVar y(x);
FloatVar z;
z=y;
\end{code}
the variables \?x?, \?y?, and \?z? all refer to the same float variable
implementation.

\paragraph{Limits.}

Float numbers range from $\mathtt{Float::Limits::min}$ to
$\mathtt{Float::Limits::max}$ which also define the numbers that
can represent float values and
float variables. The limits are defined in
the namespace \gecoderef[namespace]{Float::Limits}.

\tip{Small variable domains are still beautiful}{%
  Just like integer variables (see
  \autoref{tip:m:integer:beautifuldomains}), float variables do
  not have a constructor that creates a variable with the largest
  possible domain. And again, one has to worry and the omission
  is deliberate to make you worry. So think about the initial
  domains carefully when modeling.  }

\paragraph{Variable access functions.}

You can access the current domain of a float variable \?x? using
member functions such as \?x.min()? and \?x.max()?. Furthermore,
you can print a float variable's domain using the standard output
operator \?<<?.

\paragraph{Updating variables.}

Float variables behave exactly like integer variables during
cloning of a space. A float variable is updated by
\begin{code}
x.update(home, share, y);
\end{code}
where \?share? is the Boolean argument passed as argument to
\?copy()? and \?y? is the variable from which \?x? is to be
updated. While \?home? is the space \?x? belongs to, \?y? belongs
to the space which is being cloned.

\paragraph{Variable and argument arrays.}

Float variable arrays can be allocated using the class
\gecoderef[class]{FloatVarArray}. The constructors of this class
take the same arguments as the float variable constructors,
preceded by
the size of the array. For example,
\begin{code}
FloatVarArray x(home, 4, -1.0, 1.2);
\end{code}
creates an array of four float variables, each with domain $\range{-1.0}{1.2}$.

To pass temporary data structures as arguments, you can use the
\gecoderef[class]{FloatVarArgs} class.  Some float constraints
are defined in terms of arrays of float values. These can be
passed using the \gecoderef[class]{FloatValArgs} class. Float
variable and value argument arrays support the same operations introduced
in \autoref{sec:m:integer:args}.


\section{Constraint overview}
\label{sec:m:float:post}

This section introduces the different groups of constraints over
float variables available in Gecode. The section serves only as
an overview. For the details and the full list of available post
functions, the section refers to the relevant reference
documentation.

\paragraph{Reified constraints.}

Some float constraints (relation constraints, see
\autoref{sec:m:float:rel}, and linear constraints, see
\autoref{sec:m:float:linear}) also exist as a reified variant.
If a reified version does
exist, the reification information combining the Boolean control
variable and an optional reification mode is passed as the last
non-optional argument, see \autoref{sec:m:integer:halfreify}.

\subsection{Domain constraints}
\label{sec:m:float:dom}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelFloatDomain} constrain float variables
and variable arrays to values from a given domain. For example,
by
\begin{code}
dom(home, x, -2.0, 12.0);
\end{code}
the values of the variable \?x? (or of all variables in a
variable array \?x?) are constrained to be between the float
numbers $-2.0$ and $12.0$.
Domain constraints also take float values as argument.

The domain of a float variable \?x? can be
constrained according to the domain of another float variable \?d? by
\begin{code}
dom(home, x, d);
\end{code}
Here, \?x? and \?d? can also be arrays of float
variables.

Domain constraints for a single variable also support
reification.

\subsection{Simple relation constraints}
\label{sec:m:float:rel}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\quad}l@{\qquad}l@{\quad}l}
\?FRT_EQ? & equality ($=$) &
\?FRT_NQ? & disequality ($\neq$) \\
\?FRT_LE? & strictly less inequality ($<$) &
\?FRT_LQ? & less or equal inequality ($\leq$) \\
\?FRT_GR? & strictly greater inequality ($>$) &
\?FRT_GQ? & greater or equal inequality ($\geq$)
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Float relation types}
\label{fig:m:float:frt}
\end{figure}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelFloatRelFloat} enforce relations between
float variables and between float variables and float
values. The relation depends on a float relation type
\?FloatRelType?  (see \gecoderef[group]{TaskModelFloatRelFloat}).
\autoref{fig:m:float:frt} lists the available float relation
types and their meaning.

\paragraph{Binary relation constraints.}

Assume that \?x? and \?y? are float variables. Then
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, FRT_LE, y);
\end{code}
constrains \?x? to be strictly less than \?y?. Similarly, by
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, FRT_LQ, 4.0);
\end{code}
\?x? is constrained to be less than \?4.0?. Both variants of
\?rel? also support reification.

\tip{Weak propagation for strict inequalities ($<$, $>$) and
  disequality ($\neq$)}{
\label{tip:m:float:weak}%
  Unfortunately, the propagation for strict inequality ($<$, $>$) and
  disequality ($\neq$) relations is rather weak.

  Consider the constraint \?x<y? for float variables \?x? and
  \?y? with domains $\range{a}{b}$ and $\range{c}{d}$ respectively, where $b>d$
  and $c<a$. Then one
  would like to propagate that \?x? must be less than $d$ and \?y?
  must be larger than $a$. However, this
  would require that the domains of \?x? and \?y? after
  propagation are
  the \emph{open} intervals $\rorange{a}{d}$ and $\lorange{a}{d}$. But only closed
  intervals can be represented by float variables!

  Hence, the best propagation one could get is that the new
  domains are represented by the closed intervals $\range{a}{d}$ and
  $\range{a}{d}$ (the same propagation one would get for the constraint
  $\mathtt x\leq \mathtt y$ in this case).
}

\paragraph{Constraints between variable arrays and a single
  variable.}

If \?x? is a float variable array and \?y? is an float
variable, then
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, FRT_LQ, y);
\end{code}
constrains all variables in \?x? to be less than or equal to
\?y?. Likewise,
\begin{code}
rel(home, x, FRT_GR, 7.0);
\end{code}
constrains all variables in \?x? to be larger than \?7.0?.


\subsection{Arithmetic constraints}
\label{sec:m:float:arithmetic}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{post function} &
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{constraint posted} & default\\
\hline\hline
\?min(home, x, y, z);? & $\min(\mathtt x, \mathtt y)=\mathtt z$ &\YES
\\
\?max(home, x, y, z);? & $\max(\mathtt x, \mathtt y)=\mathtt z$ &\YES
\\\hline
\?abs(home, x, y);? & $|\mathtt x|=\mathtt y$&\YES
\\\hline
\?mult(home, x, y, z);? & $\mathtt x \cdot \mathtt y=\mathtt
z$&\YES

\?sqr(home, x, y);? & ${\mathtt x}^2=\mathtt y$&\YES
\\
\?sqrt(home, x, y);? & $\sqrt{\mathtt x}=\mathtt y$&\YES

\\
\?nroot(home, x, n, y);? & $\sqrt[{\mathtt n}]{\mathtt
  x}=\mathtt y$&\YES
\\\hline
\?exp(home, x, y)? & $\exp(\mathtt{x})=\mathtt y$ &\\
\?pow(home, b, x, y)? & $\mathtt{b}^\mathtt{x}=\mathtt y$ &\\
\?log(home, x, y)? & $\log(\mathtt{x})=\mathtt y$ &\\
\?log(home, b, x, y)? & $\log_{\mathtt{b}}(\mathtt{x})=\mathtt y$ &\\\hline
\?sin(home, x, y)? & $\sin(\mathtt{x})=\mathtt y$ &\\
\?cos(home, x, y)? & $\cos(\mathtt{x})=\mathtt y$ &\\
\?tan(home, x, y)? & $\tan(\mathtt{x})=\mathtt y$ &\\\hline
\?asin(home, x, y)? & $\arcsin(\mathtt{x})=\mathtt y$ &\\
\?acos(home, x, y)? & $\arccos(\mathtt{x})=\mathtt y$ &\\
\?atan(home, x, y)? & $\arctan(\mathtt{x})=\mathtt y$ &\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption[Arithmetic constraints]{Arithmetic constraints (\?x?,
  \?y?, and \?z?  are float variables; \?n? is a non-negative
  integer; \?b? is a float number)}
\label{fig:m:float:arithmetic}
\end{figure}

In addition to the constraints summarized in
\autoref{fig:m:float:arithmetic} (see also
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelFloatArith}), the minimum and maximum
constraints are also available for float variable arrays. 
That
is, for a float variable array \?x? and a float variable
\?y?
\begin{code}
min(home, x, y);
\end{code}
constrains \?y? to be the minimum of the variables in \?x?
(\?max? is analogous). 

The constraints marked as default in
\autoref{fig:m:float:arithmetic} are always supported, the others
only if Gecode has been built accordingly, see
\autoref{m:float:mpfr}.

\subsection{Linear constraints}
\label{sec:m:float:linear}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelFloatLI} provide constraint post
functions for linear constraints over float variables. The most general variant
\begin{code}
linear(home, a, x, FRT_EQ, c);
\end{code}
posts the linear constraint
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{|\mathtt x|-1} \mathtt{a}_i \cdot \mathtt{x}_i =
\mathtt c
$$
with float value coefficients \?a? (of type
\gecoderef[class]{FloatValArgs}), float variables \?x?, and a
float value \?c?. Note that \?a? and \?x? must have the same
size. Of course, all other float relation types are supported,
see \autoref{fig:m:float:frt} for a table of float relation
types (note that, linear constraints also show poor propagation
for strict inequalities and disequality as discussed in \autoref{tip:m:float:weak}). Multiple occurrences of the same variable in \?x? are
explicitly allowed and common terms $a\cdot y$ and $b\cdot y$ for
the same variable $y$ are rewritten to $(a+b)\cdot y$ to increase
propagation.

\begin{samepage}
The array of coefficients can be omitted if all coefficients are
one. That is,
\begin{code}
linear(home, x, FRT_GR, c);
\end{code}
posts the linear constraint
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{|\mathtt x|-1} \mathtt{x}_i > \mathtt c
$$
for a variable array \?x? and a float value \?c?.
\end{samepage}

Instead of a float value \?c? as the right-hand side of the linear
constraint, a float variable can be used as well. All variants of
\?linear? support reification.


\subsection{Channel constraints}
\label{sec:m:float:channel}

\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelFloatChannel} channel float variables to integer
variables. To express that a float variable \?x? is equal to an
integer variable \?y? is by posting either
\begin{code}
channel(home, x, y);
\end{code}
\begin{samepage}
or
\begin{code}
channel(home, y, x);
\end{code}
\end{samepage}


\section{Synchronized execution}
\label{sec:m:float:exec}

Gecode offers support in
\gecoderef[group]{TaskModelFloatExec} for executing a function
(either a function or a static member function but not a member
function) when float variables become assigned. 

Assume that a function \?c? (for continuation) is defined by
\begin{code}
void c(Space& home) { ... }
\end{code}
Then
\begin{code}
wait(home, x, &c);
\end{code}
posts a propagator that waits until the float
variable \?x? (or, if \?x? is an array of float variables: all variables in
\?x?) is assigned. If \?x? becomes assigned, the function \?c? is
executed with the current home space passed as argument.

This part explains modeling and solving
constraint problems, and how to program, compile, link, and
execute constraint models.}

\paragraph{Basic material.} 

The basic material needed for modeling with Gecode is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \tcmstarted{} provides an overview of how to program,
  compile, link, and execute a constraint model in Gecode.
\item \tcmcomfy{} discusses functionality in Gecode that
  makes modeling and execution of models more convenient.
\item The three first sections of \tcmint{} explain integer and
  Boolean variables \ptsmintegervar{}, variable and argument
  arrays \ptsmintegerproper{}, and how constraints are posted
  \ptsmintegergeneric{}.
\item The first section of \tcmset{} gives an overview of set
  variables \ptsmsetvar{}.
\item The first section of \tcmfloat{} gives an overview of float
  variables \ptsmfloatvar{}.
\item The first sections of \tcmbranch{} explain branching: basics \ptsmbranchbasics,
  branchings for integer and Boolean variables \ptsmbranchint,
  branchings for set variables \ptsmbranchset, and branchings for
  float variables \ptsmbranchfloat.
\item Even though not strictly necessary
  for modeling, it is recommended to also read
  \tsmsearchre{} and \tsmsearchparallel{} that explain how search
  (and in particular parallel search) works in Gecode.
\end{itemize}
\autoref{part:c} features a collection of example models
for Gecode as further reading.

  topics for branchings: local versus shared variable selection
  \ptsmbranchshared, random selection \ptsmbranchrnd,
  user-defined variable \ptsmbranchuservar and value
  \ptsmbranchuserval selection, tie-breaking \ptsmbranchtie,
  assigning variables
  \ptsmbranchassign, and executing code between branchers

{\parindent 0em This part presents a collection of modeling case
  studies. The case studies are ordered (roughly) according to
  their complexity.  
}

\paragraph{Basic models.} 

The basic models use classic constraint programming problems in
order to demonstrate how typical modeling tasks are done with
Gecode. The basic models are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \tccgolomb{} shows a simple problem with a single
  \?distinct?  constraint and a few \?rel? constraints. As the
  problem is so well known, it might serve as an initial case
  study of how to model with Gecode.
\item \tccmagicsequence{} shows how to use counting constraints
  (\?count?).
\item \tccphoto{} shows how to use reified constraints for
  solving an overconstrained problem.
\item \tccwarehouses{} shows how to use \?element?, \?linear?,
  and global
  counting (\?count?)  constraints.
\item \tccnonogram{} shows how to use regular expressions and
  extensional constraints.
\item \tccgolf{} presents a case study on modeling problems using
  set variables and constraints.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Advanced models.}

The following models are slightly more advanced:
\begin{itemize}
\item \tccknights{} demonstrates a problem-specific brancher
  inspired by a classic heuristic for a classic problem. 
\item \tccbpp{} also demonstrates a problem-specific brancher
  including techniques for breaking symmetries during branching.
\item \tcckakuro{} presents a model that employs user-defined
  constraints implemented as \?extensional? constraints using
  tuple set specifications. Interestingly, the tuple set
  specifications are computed by solving a simple constraint
  problem.
\item \tcccrossword{} presents a simple model using nothing but
  \?distinct? and \?element?  constraints. The simple model is
  shown to work quite well compared to a dedicated
  problem-specific constraint solver. This underlines that an
  efficient general-purpose constraint programming system
  actually can go a long way.
\end{itemize}
Note that the first two
  case studies require knowledge on programming branchers,
  see \autoref{part:b}.
\vfill
\paragraph{Acknowledgments.}
We thank Pierre Flener and Håkan Kjellerstrand for numerous
detailed and helpful comments on the case studies. Their comments
have considerably improved the presentation of the case studies.

This part explains how to program propagators as implementations
of constraints.
}

\paragraph{Basic material.}

\mbox{}\tcpstarted{} shows how to implement simple propagators
for simple constraints over integer variables. It introduces the
basic concepts and techniques that are necessary for any
propagator. 

\paragraph{Programming techniques.}

The bulk of this part describes a wide range of techniques for
programming efficient propagators:
\begin{itemize}
\item \tcpavoid{} discusses techniques for avoiding propagator
  execution. The examples used in this chapter introduce view
  arrays for propagators and Boolean views.
\item \tcpreified{} discusses how to implement propagators for
  reified constraints and how to optimize constraint propagation
  by propagator rewriting.
\item \tcpdomain{} explains various programming techniques for
  propagators that perform domain propagation. The chapter also
  describes modification event deltas as information available to
  propagators and staging as a technique for speeding up domain
  propagation.
\item \tcpadvisors{} is concerned with advisors for efficient
  incremental propagation. Advisors can be used to provide
  information to a propagator which of its views have changed and
  how they have changed.
\item \tcpviews{} shows how to straightforwardly and efficiently
  reuse propagators for implementing several different
  constraints by using views. As it comes to importance, this
  chapter ranks second after \autoref{chap:p:started}. However,
  it comes rather late to be able to draw on the example
  propagators presented in the previous chapters.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Overview material.}

The following chapters summarize or provide an overview of topics
related to programming propagators:
\begin{itemize}
\item \tcpsets{} summarizes how to implement propagators for
constraints over set variables.
\item \tcpfloats{} summarizes how to implement propagators for
  constraints over float variables.
\item \tcpmemory{} provides an overview of memory management for
  propagators (and branchers, see \autoref{part:b}).

\tcbstarted{} shows how to implement simple branchers. More
advanced topics are discussed in \tcbadvanced{}.

How to implement a whole array of variable-value branchings (a
need that typically arises when implementing new variables) is
discussed in \autoref{chap:v:branch} of \autoref{part:b}.

This part explains how new variable types can be programmed
with Gecode.
}

In order to be able to program variables, all chapters in this
part should be read.  The chapters capture the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \tcvstarted{} outlines how a new variable type can be
  programmed for Gecode.
\item \tcvvarimp{} shows how the kernel-specific and variable
  domain-specific aspects of a variable implementation are
  specified and programmed.
\item \tcvvar{} shows how variables and variable arrays for
  modeling are programmed for a given variable implementation.
\item \tcvview{} shows how views for programming propagators and
  branchers are programmed for a given variable implementation.
\item \tcvbranch{} explains how variable-value branchings can be
  implemented from functionality provided by Gecode.
\item \tcvall{} finally explains how a new variable type can be
  used with Gecode.
\end{itemize}

\begin{important}
  Programming variables requires to configure and recompile
  Gecode from its source code. Using one of the pre-compiled
  packages is not sufficient. More details can be found in
  \autoref{chap:v:all}.

\tcsstarted{} presents how to implement simple search engines,
where the focus is on understanding the basic operations
available on spaces to implement search engines.  \tcsre{} explains recomputation as the most essential
technique for efficient search in Gecode. 
\tcsengine{} puts all techniques for search and recomputation
from \autoref{chap:s:started} and \autoref{chap:s:re} together
and presents a realistic search engine.

%% FILES: CHAPTERONLY

This chapter studies the classic bin packing problem.  Three
models are presented: a first and naive model (presented in
\autoref{sec:c:bpp:naive}) that suffers from poor propagation to
be feasible. This is followed by a model
(\autoref{sec:c:bpp:prop}) that uses the special \?binpacking?
constraint to drastically improve constraint propagation. A final
model improves the second model by a problem-specific branching
(\autoref{sec:c:bpp:branch}) that also breaks many symmetries during
search.

\begin{important}
  This case study requires knowledge on programming
  branchers, see \autoref{part:b}.

\section{Problem}
\label{sec:c:bpp:problem}

The bin packing problem consists of packing $\mathtt{n}$ items of
sizes $\mathtt{size}_i$ ($0\leq i<\mathtt{n}$) into the
smallest number of bins such that the capacity $\mathtt{c}$ of
each bin is not exceeded.

For example, the $11$ items of sizes
$$
  6,6,6,5,3,3,2,2,2,2,2
$$
require at least four bins of capacity $10$ as shown in
\autoref{fig:c:bpp:optimal} where the items are numbered starting
from zero.



\section{A naive model}
\label{sec:c:bpp:naive}

Before turning our attention to a naive model for the bin packing
problem, this section discusses instance data for the bin
packing problem and how to compute lower and upper bounds for the
number of required bins.

\paragraph{Instance data.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive:instance data}
\caption{Instance data for a bin packing problem}
\label{fig:c:bpp:data}
\end{figure}

\mbox{}\autoref{fig:c:bpp:data} shows an example instance of a
bin packing problem, where \?n? defines the number of items, \?c?
defines the capacity of each \?bin?, and the array \?size?
defines the size of each item. For simplicity, we assume that the
item size are ordered in decreasing order.

The data corresponds to the instance \?N1C1W1_N? taken
from~\cite{BISON:1997}. More information on other data instances
can be found in \autoref{sec:c:bpp:info}.

\paragraph{Computing a lower bound.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive:compute lower bound}
\caption{Computing a lower bound for the number of bins}
\label{fig:c:bpp:lower}
\end{figure}

\mbox{}A simple lower bound $L_1$ (following Martello and
Toth~\cite{MartelloToth:1990}) for the number of bins required
for a bin packing problem just considers the size of all items
and the bin capacity as follows:
$$
L_1=\left\lceil\frac{1}{c}\sum_{i=0}^{\mathtt{n}-1} \mathtt{size}_i\right\rceil
$$

The computation of the lower bound $L_1$ is as to be expected and
is shown in \autoref{fig:c:bpp:lower}. The ceiling
operation is replaced by adding $\mathtt{c}-1$ followed by
truncating integer division with~$\mathtt{c}$. 

Note that more accurate lower bounds are known, see
\autoref{sec:c:bpp:info} for more information.

\paragraph{Computing an upper bound.}

An obvious upper bound for the number of bins required is the
number of items: each item is packed into a separate bin 
(provided that no item size exceeds the bin capacity \?c?). A
better upper bound can be computed by constructing a
solution by packing items into bins following a first-fit
strategy: pack all items into the first bin of sufficient free
capacity. 

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive:compute upper bound}
\caption{Computing an upper bound for the number of bins}
\label{fig:c:bpp:upper}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:c:bpp:upper} shows the function \?upper()? that
returns an upper bound for the number of bins. It initializes an
array \?free? of \?n? integers with the bin capacity \?c?. The
integer \?u? refers to the index of the last used bin (that is, a
bin into which an item has been packed). The function returns the
number of used bins (that is, the index \?u? plus one).

Each item is packed into a bin with sufficient free capacity
where \?j? refers to the next free bin:
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive:pack items into free bins}

The next free bin \?j? is searched for as follows:
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive:find free bin}
The loop always terminates as there is one bin for
each item.

Note that \?upper()? has $O(\mathtt{n}^2)$ complexity in the
worst case but could be made more efficient by speeding up
finding a fitting bin.

\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
\caption{An non-optimal bin packing found during upper bound computation}
\label{fig:c:bpp:greedy}
\end{figure}

The solution constructed during computation of \?upper()? is not
necessarily optimal. As an example, consider the packing computed by \?upper()?
for the example from \autoref{sec:c:bpp:problem} shown in
\autoref{fig:c:bpp:greedy}: it takes five rather than four bins
because one of the items~4 and~5 should be packed together with
item~3 rather than
with one of the items~0,~1, and~2.  

If both lower and upper bound coincide the solution
constructed is of course optimal and we are done solving the bin
packing problem. For reasons of simplicity, our model just
forsakes this opportunity and re-computes an optimal solution by
constraint programming.

\paragraph{Model proper.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive}
\caption{A naive script for solving a bin packing problem}
\label{fig:c:bpp:naive}
\end{figure}

\mbox{}\autoref{fig:c:bpp:naive} shows a script for the bin
packing model. The script defines integers \?l? and \?u? that
store the lower and upper bound as discussed above. A \emph{load
  variable} $\mathtt{load}_i$ (taking values from
$\range{0}{\mathtt{c}}$) defines the total size of all items
packed into bin $i$. The script uses \?u? load
variables as the upper bound guarantees that \?u? bins are
sufficient to find an optimal solution. A \emph{bin variable}
$\mathtt{bin}_i$ (taking values from $\range{0}{\mathtt{u}-1}$
defines for each item $i$ into which bin it is packed. The variable
\?bins? defines the number of \emph{used bins}. A bin is
\emph{used} if at least one item is packed into it, otherwise it
is an \emph{excess} bin.

The integer \?s? is initialized as the size of all items and
\?sizes? is initialized as an integer argument array of all sizes.

The \?cost()? function as required by the class \?MinimizeScript?
(see \autoref{sec:m:driver:script}) returns the number of
\?bins?.

\paragraph{Excess bins.}

If the script finds a solution that uses less than \?u? bins, say
\?k? (the value of the \?bins? variable), then
$\mathtt{u}-\mathtt{k}$ of the load variables corresponding to
excess bins are zero. To remove many symmetrical solutions that
only differ in which bins are excess bins, the script constrains
the excess bins to be the bins $\mathtt{k},\ldots,\mathtt{u}-1$:
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive:excess bins}

\paragraph{Constraining load and bin variables.}

The sum of all load variables must be equal to the size of all
items:
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive:loads add up to item sizes}

The load variable for a bin must be constrained according
to which items are packed into the bin. A standard formulation of
this constraint uses Boolean variables $\mathtt{x}_{i,j}$ which
determine whether item $i$ has been packed into bin $j$. That is,
for each item $0\leq i<\mathtt{n}$ the following constraint must
hold:
$$
\mathtt{x}_{i,j}=1\iff \mathtt{bin}_i=j\qquad (0\leq
j<\mathtt{u})
$$

A more efficient propagator for the very same constraint is
available as a \?channel? constraint between an array of Boolean
variables and a single integer variable, see
\autoref{sec:m:integer:channel}. That is, for each item $0\leq
i<\mathtt{n}$ the following constraint must hold:
$$
\mathtt{channel}(\langle
\mathtt{x}_{i,0},\mathtt{x}_{i,1},\ldots,
\mathtt{x}_{i,u-1}\rangle,\mathtt{bin}_i)
$$
Note that $\langle
\mathtt{x}_{i,0},\mathtt{x}_{i,1},\ldots,
\mathtt{x}_{i,u-1}\rangle$ corresponds to \?x.col(?$i$\?)?.

Furthermore, the size of all items packed into a bin must equal
the corresponding load variable.
Both constraints are expressed as follows, using a matrix \?x? (see
\autoref{sec:m:minimodel:matrix}) of
Boolean variables \?_x?:
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive:loads are equal to packed items}

\paragraph{Symmetry breaking.}

Items of the same size are equivalent as far as the model is
concerned. To break symmetries, the bins for items of
the same size are ordered:
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive:symmetry breaking}
The loop exploits that items are ordered according to
size and hence items of the same size are adjacent.

\paragraph{Pack items that require a bin.}

If the size $s$ of an item exceeds $\lceil\frac{\mathtt{c}}{2}\rceil$
(or, equivalently, $2s>\mathtt{c}$), the item cannot share a bin
with any other item also exceeding half of the capacity. That is,
items exceeding half of the capacity can be directly assigned to
different bins:
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive:pack items that require a bin}

The assignment of items to bins is compatible with the
symmetry breaking constraints discussed previously.

\paragraph{Branching.}

We choose a naive branching strategy that first branches on the number of
required \?bins?, followed by trying to assign items to bins.
\insertlitcode{bin packing naive:branching}

Note that by choosing the \?bin? variables with order
\?INT_VAR_NONE()? assigns the largest item to a bin first as items
are sorted by decreasing size.

The script in \autoref{fig:c:bpp:naive} does not show that the
script uses branch-and-bound search to find a best solution. Why
depth-first search is not sufficient with parallel search is
discussed in \autoref{tip:m:search:parbab}.

\paragraph{Running the model.}

When running the naive model\footnote{All measurements in this
  chapter have been made on a laptop with an Intel i5 M430
  processor (2.27 GHz, two cores, hyper-threading), 4~GB of main
  memory, running Windows~7 x64, and using Gecode 3.4.3.}, it
becomes apparent that the model is indeed naive. Finding the best
solution takes $29.5$ seconds and $2\,451\,018$ failures.
Clearly, that leaves ample room for improvement in the
following sections!

% Time: 29523.6ms


\section{Improving propagation}
\label{sec:c:bpp:prop}

This section improves (and simplifies) the naive model from the
previous section by using a dedicated \?binpacking? constraint.

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{bin packing propagation}
\caption{A script with improved propagation for solving a bin packing problem}
\label{fig:c:bpp:prop}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Model.}

The improved model is shown in \autoref{fig:c:bpp:prop}. Instead
of using Boolean variables \?x?, \?linear? constraints, and
\?channel? constraints it uses the \?binpacking? constraint (see
also \autoref{sec:m:integer:bpp}). The constraint enforces that
the packing of items as defined by the \?bin? variables
corresponds to the \?load? variables.

\paragraph{Running the model.}

Finding a best solution using the model with improved propagation
takes $1.5$ seconds and $64\,477$ failures. That is, this model
runs almost $20$ times faster than the naive model and reduces
the number of failures by a factor of $38$.

%Time: 1488.7ms



\section{Improving branching}
\label{sec:c:bpp:branch}

This section describes a problem specific branching to improve
the model of the previous section even further.

\paragraph{Complete decreasing best fit branching.}

The improved branching for bin packing is called
complete decreasing best-fit (CDBF) and is due to Gent and
Walsh~\cite{CDBF}. The branching uses some additional
improvements suggested by Shaw in~\cite{Shaw:CP:2004}.

The branching tries to assign items to bins during search where
the items are tried in order of decreasing size. The bin is
selected according to a best fit strategy: try to put the item
into a bin with sufficient but least free space. The space of the
bin after packing an item is called the bin's \emph{slack}. If
there is no bin with sufficient free space left, CDBF fails.

Suppose that CDBF selects item \?i? and bin \?b?. Then the
following actions are taken during branching:
\begin{itemize}
\item If there is a perfect fit (that is, the slack is zero),
  branching assigns item \?i? to bin \?b?. This corresponds to a
  branching with a single alternative.
\item If all possible bins have the same slack, branching assigns
  item \?i? to bin \?b?. Again, this corresponds to a
  branching with a single alternative.
\item Otherwise, CDBF tries two alternatives in the following order:
\begin{itemize}
\item Assign item \?i? to bin \?b?.
\item Not only prune bin \?b? from the potential bins for item
  \?i? but also prune all bins with the same slack as \?b? from the
  potential bins for all items with the same size as \?i?.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Note that the second alternative of CDBF performs symmetry
breaking during search as it prunes also with respect to
equivalent items and bins.

\paragraph{Model.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching}
\caption{A script with improved branching for solving a bin packing problem}
\label{fig:c:bpp:branch}
\end{figure}

The only change to the model compared to \autoref{sec:c:bpp:prop}
is that it uses the branching \?cdbf? for assigning items to bins
during search.

\paragraph{Brancher creation.}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching:CDBF}
\caption{CDBF brancher and branching}
\label{fig:c:bpp:cdbf}
\end{figure}

The \?cdbf? branching takes load variables (for computing the
free space of a bin), bin variables (to pack items into bins),
and the item sizes (to compute how much space an item requires)
as input and posts the \?CDBF? brancher as shown in
\autoref{fig:c:bpp:cdbf}. 

The branching post function \?cdbf()? creates view arrays for the
respective variables, creates a shared integer array of type
\?IntSharedArray? (see \autoref{tip:m:integer:sharedelement}) and
posts a \?CDBF? brancher.
The advantage of using a shared array is that the sizes are
stored only once in memory and branchers in different spaces have
shared access to the same memory area (see also
\autoref{sec:p:memory:shared}). 

The brancher \?CDBF? stores the load variables, bin variables,
and item sizes together with an integer \?item?. The integer
\?item? is used to find the next unassigned item. It is declared
\?mutable? so that the \?const? \?status()? function (see below)
can modify it. The brancher exploits that the items are sorted by
decreasing size: by initializing \?item? to zero the brancher is
trying to pack the largest item first.

By default, the \?dispose()? member function of a brancher is not
called when the brancher's home space is deleted. However, the
\?dispose()?  function of the \?CDBF? brancher must call the
destructor of the shared integer array \?size?. Hence, the
constructor of \?CDBF?  calls the \?notice()? function of the
home space so that the brancher's \?dispose()? function is called
when home is deleted (see also \autoref{par:p:started:dispose}).
Likewise, the \?dispose()? function calls the \?ignore()?
function before the brancher is disposed.

\paragraph{Status computation.}

The \?status()? function tries to find a yet unassigned view for
branching in the view array \?bin?. It starts inspecting the
views at position \?item? and skips all already assigned
views. If there is a not yet assigned view left, \?item? is
updated to that unassigned view and \?true? is returned (that is,
more branching is needed). Otherwise, the brancher returns
\?false? as no more branching is needed:
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching:status function}
As the items are sorted by decreasing size, the integer \?item?
refers to the largest not-yet packed item.

\paragraph{Choice computation: initialization.}

The \?choice()? function implements the actual heuristic. The
function uses \?n? for the number of items, \?m? for the
number of bins, and initializes a \?region? for managing
temporary memory (see \autoref{par:p:memory:region}) as follows:
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching:choice function}
The \?choice()? function can rely on the fact that it is
immediately executed after the \?status()? function has been
executed. That entails that \?item? refers to the largest not-yet
packed item.

\begin{samepage}
The function computes in \?free? the free space of each bin. From the maximal load the size of items that have
already been packed (that is, the item's \?bin? variable is already
assigned) is subtracted:
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching:initialize free space in bins}
\end{samepage}

The \?choice()? function uses the integer \?slack? to track the
slack of the so-far best fit (initialized with \?INT_MAX? such
that any fit will be better). The integer \?n_possible? counts
the number of possible bins for the item whereas \?n_same? counts
the number of best fits. The array \?same? stores all bins with
the same so-far smallest slack.
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching:initialize bins with same slack}
The array \?same? is initialized to contain the bin \?-1?: if no
bin has sufficient space for the current item this will
guarantee that the \?commit()? function (see below) leads to
failure.

\paragraph{Choice computation: create choice.}

In order to find all best fits, all bins are examined. If the
current item fits into a bin, the number of possible bins
\?n_possible? is incremented and all best fits are remembered in
the array \?same? as follows:
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching:find best fit}
Note that finding a better fit updates \?slack? and resets the
bins stored in \?same?.

\begin{samepage}
Now, the \?choice()? function determines whether a special case
needs to be dealt with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Is the best fit a perfect fit: that is,
\?slack? is zero? 
\item Are all fits a best fit: that is,
\?n_same? is equal to \?n_possible?? 
\item Is there no fitting bin: that is,
\?n_possible? is zero? 
\end{itemize}
\end{samepage}
In these cases a choice with a single
alternative and otherwise a choice with two
alternatives is created:
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching:create choice}

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching:CDBF choice}
\caption{CDBF choice}
\label{fig:c:bpp:choice}
\end{figure}

The definition of the choice class is shown in
\autoref{fig:c:bpp:choice}. The choice stores the current
item and in the array \?same? all bins with the same slack. The
choice does not need to store any information regarding items of
same size as this information is available from the brancher.


\paragraph{Commit function.}

\begin{samepage}
The \?commit()? function takes a choice of type \?CDBF::Choice?
and the alternative \?a? (either \?0? or \?1?) as input:
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching:commit function}
\end{samepage}

Committing to the first alternative tries to pack \?item? into
the first bin stored in \?same? as follows:
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching:commit to first alternative}

Committing to the second alternative removes all \?n_same? bins
stored in \?same? from all items that have the same size as
\?item? as follows:
\insertlitcode{bin packing branching:commit to second alternative}
The iterator \gecoderef[class]{Iter::Values::Array} iterates over
all values stored in an array (they must be in sorted order) and
the operation \?minus_v()? prunes all values as defined by an
iterator from a view, see \autoref{sec:p:domain:iter}.


\paragraph{Running the model.}

Finding a best solution using the model with improved propagation
and improved branching
takes $84$ milliseconds and $3\,098$ failures. That is, this model
runs $352$ times faster than the naive model and reduces
the number of failures by a factor of $791$.
